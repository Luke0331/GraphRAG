Furthermore, adding optical transparency to a con- ventional c-Si wafer is one of the most challenging problems in this ﬁeld. Here, we demonstrate the development of a neutral-colored transparent c-Si sub- strate using a 200-mm-thick c-Si wafer, which is known to be intrinsically opaque. Transparent c-Si substrates were fabricated by placing microhole-shaped light transmission windows on a bare c-Si wafer. These windows were designed to enable the transmission of all incident visible light through the substrate, result- ing in a colorless substrate. A light absorption area was also designed on the wafer to efﬁciently absorb incident light. As a representative application, solar cells fabricated using the neutral-colored transparent c-Si substrate showed a power conversion efﬁciency of up to 12.2%. Therefore, our transparent c-Si so- lar cells present a unique opportunity to develop next-generation colorless transparent photovoltaics. INTRODUCTION Transparent solar cells are attractive energy conversion devices because they can be used in various applications in our daily life, such as building-integrated photo- voltaics (BIPV) and vehicle-integrated photovoltaics (VIPV).1 To date, transparent so- lar cells based on organic photovoltaics, dye-sensitized solar cells, and perovskite solar cells have been developed.24 Because most materials that are used in these solar cells could be easily made into thin ﬁlms through the solution process, these thin ﬁlms have light transmission properties. However, the transparent solar cells developed to date have limitations in power conversion efﬁciency (PCE) and stabil- ity. Furthermore, they exhibit speciﬁc colors as a result of the colors of the polymers or dyes used. To address this issue, some researchers have developed selective ultraviolet (UV)- or near-infrared (NIR)-absorbing transparent solar cells to fabricate neutral-colored transparent solar cells.5,6 However, UV- or NIR-absorbing trans- parent solar cells have demonstrated very low PCEs (2%) until now. Accordingly, a different approach is required to develop transparent solar cells with neutral color, high PCE, and long-term stability. As a method to develop neutral-colored transparent solar cells with high PCE and long-term stability, crystalline-silicon (c-Si)-based transparent solar cells could be considered. c-Si is a representative semiconductor widely used in various devices, such as transistors, integrated circuit chips, and solar cells owing to its abundance and high physical stability.79 However, the increasing demand for transparent elec- tronics, including transparent photovoltaics,1,10 is making the use of c-Si signiﬁcantly challenging. Conventional c-Si wafers with thicknesses in the range of 150200 mm, Context & Scale Transparent solar cells are attractive energy conversion devices because they can be used in various applications in our daily life, such as building-integrated photovoltaics. However, transparent solar cells developed to date have limitations in efﬁciency and stability. Crystalline silicon (c-Si) is one of the best candidates to develop transparent solar cells with high efﬁciency and stability, because conventional c-Si solar cells are known to exhibit high efﬁciency and long-term stability compared with other solar cells. However, the opaque characteristic of the c- Si wafer hinders the development of transparent solar cells using c- Si. Here, we present a novel approach to develop neutral- colored transparent c-Si solar cells that exhibit the highest efﬁciency among neutral-colored transparent solar cells developed to date. Furthermore, we believe that this study makes a signiﬁcant contribution not only to the ﬁeld of photovoltaics but also to various transparent electronics. Joule 4, 235246, January 15, 2020 ª 2019 Elsevier Inc. 235 which are mostly used in commercial technology requiring complete optical absorp- tion and safe handling, are unable to transmit wavelengths in the visible light range (400750 nm).11 Thinning of c-Si has been conventionally considered as a method to increase the transparency of devices because the light intensity transmitted through a material (IT) is generally inversely proportional to the thickness of the material according to Beer-Lambert law (IT = I0eb[, where I0, b, and [, respectively, indicate the incident light intensity, absorption coefﬁcient, and thickness of a substrate). Therefore, several researchers have attempted to develop semi-transparent c-Si substrates by reducing the light absorption depth through the fabrication of ultra-thin c-Si ﬁlms.12 However, as the absorption of long-wavelength light is extremely limited in thin ﬁlms, their potential application to solar cells is also limited. In particular, a thin c-Si ﬁlm develops a reddish hue because of absorption spectrum cutoffs in the visible light wavelength range.12 Here, we demonstrate an alternative approach to constructing a transparent c-Si substrate with a neutral color similar to glass even when a relatively thick wafer is used (a thickness of 200 mm was used in this study). We placed microhole-shaped light transmission windows, which are not visible to the naked human eye, on a 200-mm-thick c-Si wafer. Systematic tuning of the transmittance of the substrate was then carried out by adjusting the design of the light transmission windows. In addition, as a representative application, transparent solar cells fabricated using the transparent c-Si substrate over an area of 1 cm2 showed a high PCE of 12.2% (transmittance, 20%) corresponding to a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 29.2 mA/cm2, open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 588 mV, and ﬁll factor (FF) of 71.1%. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Design and Fabrication of Transparent c-Si To endow a 200-mm-thick c-Si substrate with neutral-colored transparency, as shown in Figure 1A (see also Figure S1), hole-shaped light transmission windows were fabricated throughout the wafer thickness (labeled a in Figures 1B and 1C). The diameters of the holes (d) were optimized to be rationalized by a ray-optical regime so that a broad band of light from UV to NIR can be transmitted with min- imum nanophotonic effect (i.e., diffractive colorization). In addition, the spacing (s) between the holes was appropriately selected by considering the minimum angle of resolution for humans to ensure that the individual transmission windows are not visible to the human eye. Thus, a c-Si substrate was made transparent with a neutral color similar to that of glass, which is enough for esthetic purposes in prac- tical applications such as in BIPV and VIPV. Furthermore, a 200-mm-thick c-Si wafer used for fabricating commercial c-Si solar cells was used to effectively absorb inci- dent light in the range of 3001,100 nm in the light absorption area (labeled b in Figures 1B and 1C). The light transmission windows were designed considering the hole diameters through which visible light wavelengths can be transmitted. Figure 2 summarizes the numerically predicted diffractive behaviors of a c-Si hole array with respect to d. The ﬁnite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method, supported by a commercial package (CST Microwavestudio 2014), was used for numerical predictions. The re- sults for c-Si hole arrays with 500 nm and 100 mm diameter are shown in Figure 2 as representative examples of nanophotonic and ray-optic regimes. Figure S2A pre- sents the results of the use of a c-Si hole array with differently varying diameters from 1Department of Energy Engineering, Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology, Ulsan 44919, Korea 2KU-KIST Graduate School of Converging Science and Technology, Korea University, Seoul 02841, Korea 3Department of Biomicrosystem Technology, Korea University, Seoul 02841, Korea 4These authors contributed equally 5Lead Contact *Correspondence: seungwoo@korea.ac.kr (S.L.), kseo@unist.ac.kr (K.S.) https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joule.2019.11.008 236 Joule 4, 235246, January 15, 2020 500 nm to 100 mm. Incident light with 500 nm wavelength (representative wave- length) was assumed to be propagated from top to bottom (along z axis); the hole-patterned c-Si was located at the bottom side (gray-colored box in Figure 2). As the c-Si hole array was quite thick (i.e., 200 mm), forward diffraction was not visible. Therefore, we used backward diffraction to indicate whether a c-Si hole array with a different diameter can be included in a nanophotonic regime. These backward spatial distributions of electric ﬁeld intensity were normalized to the maximal ampli- tude of the diffraction intensity. Figures S2BS2D show corresponding data without normalization. For a ﬂat c-Si layer (Figure 2A), standing plane waves due to interfer- ence between the incident and reﬂected waves are clearly visible. In contrast, the c-Si with a hole array of 500 nm diameter (Figure 2B) produced diffraction, evi- denced by a distinct light pattern along the backward direction (i.e., nanophotonic regime). Thus, structural colorization resulting from diffraction can occur in this regime. It is also noteworthy that the intensity of the diffractive light pattern decreases with increasing d (see Figure S2A). Indeed, a d larger than 90 mm was suf- ﬁcient to avoid diffraction in the visible light region (i.e., ray-optic regime). In partic- ular, the back diffraction intensity for a d larger than 90 mm (e.g., 100 mm) is Figure 1.

(C) Illustration of the neutral-colored transparent c-Si substrate. Light (in all wavelength ranges) is transmitted through the hole-shaped light transmission window. The incident light is effectively absorbed in the light absorption region. Joule 4, 235246, January 15, 2020 237 signiﬁcantly lower than for a d smaller than 10 mm, and the back-diffracted light shows almost plane wave propagation (Figure S2). Therefore, diffraction and its rele- vant structural colorization can be avoided for a d larger than 90 mm. Accordingly, we punched holes with diameters larger than 90 mm (i.e., 90100 mm) into a 200-mm- thick c-Si layer using deep reactive ion etching (DRIE). Figure 2. Numerically Simulated, Normalized Spatial Distribution of the Electric Field Intensity that Was Reﬂected and Diffracted in the Backward Direction Illumination with the 500-nm-wavelength light was assumed to occur from top to bottom. The gray boxes indicate the surface of the (A) ﬂat and (B and C) hole-arrayed c-Si with different hole diameters (500 nm and 100 mm). (A) Without the hole, the reﬂected wave undergoes interference with the incident light and forms a standing plane wave. (B and C) In the presence of the arrayed hole, back diffractions were clearly observed, as evidenced by a spatial pattern of light intensity (nanophotonic regime). As the periodicity or hole size is increased beyond 90 mm, this diffraction becomes negligible (ray-optics regime). Indeed, spatial distribution of electric ﬁeld intensity without normalization indicates that the light reﬂected back from the 100 mm microhole array can form plane-like waves (see Figure S2). 238 Joule 4, 235246, January 15, 2020 In addition to adjusting the d of the microhole, the s between each microhole should be optimized to achieve complete transparency of the substrate. The spacing be- tween the holes in the microhole array was determined by considering the minimum angle of resolution for the human eye, namely 1 arcmin (1/60).13 Therefore, if the angle between s and the human eye is less than 1 arcmin, the human eye will be un- able to detect the hole pattern (Figure S3). This is described in Equation 1: s  2pL 3  1 360  3 1 60 : (Equation 1) In Equation 1, L is the distance between the transparent c-Si substrate and the eye, and s is the spacing between the holes. According to Equation 1, when a transparent c-Si sub- strate is viewed from a distance of 6 m (20 ft), which is the standard distance for vision check, the human eye is unable to recognize the hole pattern if the spacing between the holes is less than 1.75 mm (assuming the person has normal visual acuity, also called 20/20 vision).14 The spacing of holes in the transparent c-Si substrate is maintained using a micrometer scale, enabling the spacing to be much smaller than 1.75 mm such that the hole pattern will be invisible even at a distance of 30 cm (12 in), which is the appropriate distance for using mobile devices (e.g., smartphones).15 This transparent c-Si substrate also allows the object behind it to be clearly visible without visual distortion. The reﬂected light from the object is not diffused during transmission through the transparent c-Si substrate. We calculated the optical haze using Equation 2 to quantitatively evaluate light diffused through the trans- parent c-Si substrate:16 Hð%Þ = Td Tt 3 100: (Equation 2) In this equation, Td is the diffuse transmittance, and Tt is the total transmittance (diffuse transmittance + specular transmittance). The results clearly show that the haze ratio of the transparent c-Si substrate is 0.95%, which indicates that there is almost no haziness, similar to the case of glass (%H, 0.89%; Figure S4). Systematic Transmittance Control of Transparent c-Si Substrate The transmittance of the transparent c-Si substrate can be easily controlled while maintaining neutral color. Visible light can only pass through the microhole areas because the thickness of the c-Si substrate is otherwise sufﬁcient to absorb this light (i.e., 200 mm; Figure S5). Therefore, the transmittance of the substrate can be controlled by calculating the ﬁlling fraction of the c-Si substrate; this is the ratio of the area of the light absorption region, excluding the microhole area, to the entire area of the substrate. To create a transparent c-Si substrate with various transmit- tances from 50% to 20%, the ﬁlling fraction of each unit cell was controlled within the range of 50%80% by tuning d, s, and the number of microholes (Figure 3A; Sup- plemental Information). Instead of a random geometry, the microholes were de- signed to be regularly arrayed. In a random geometry, the spacing between the holes could be comparable to the wavelength of interest; thus, a speciﬁc resonant mode, for example, the localization of an electromagnetic ﬁeld (referred to as An- derson localization),17,18 could lead to colorization at a speciﬁc wavelength. There- fore, regularly arrayed structures were designed, as shown in Figure 3B. In stark contrast to the relatively thin c-Si substrates, transparent c-Si substrates with such a design produced a neutral color with a range of transmittances as shown Figure 3C (see Figure S6). We also veriﬁed that the transmittance can be tuned systematically according to the ﬁlling fraction by measuring the total transmittance (diffuse transmittance + specular transmittance) using a UV-visible-NIR (UV-vis-NIR) Joule 4, 235246, January 15, 2020 239 spectrophotometer (Figure 3D). The measured total transmittance was indeed found to be the same over a broad band of UV-NIR regimes because there was no transmission cut-on wavelength, indicating that the transparent c-Si substrate had a neutral color. These results are in good agreement with theoretical predictions based on the ﬁnite element method (FEM), as shown in Figure S7, further indicating that the developed transparent c-Si substrate with 200-mm thickness can be approx- imated better by ray-optical analysis than nanophotonic effect. Photovoltaic Performance of Transparent c-Si Solar Cells Finally, we demonstrated a photovoltaic device with a broadband transmittance of 20%50% using the transparent c-Si substrate (Figures 4A and S8). A p-type emitter layer with a junction depth of 600 nm was formed on an n-type Czochralski Si wafer with a resistivity of 13 U$cm using spin-on doping (SOD) to form a p-n junction (Fig- ure S9). A highly doped Si layer (n+) was formed on the rear surface of the transparent c-Si solar cells to form an ohmic contact and a back-surface ﬁeld (BSF), and a honey- comb-patterned metal microgrid electrode was then applied as the top electrode. The optical loss due to the top electrode would be minimized because the microgrid electrode was designed to have a high transmittance of 97% without a speciﬁc color- ization (Figure S10). In addition, atomic layer deposition (ALD) was used to deposit a 10-nm-thick Al2O3 ﬁlm on the sample to minimize surface recombination induced by Figure 3.

(D) Total transmittance spectra of the transparent c-Si substrate with ﬁlling fractions of 50% (blue line), 60% (green line), 70% (yellow line), and 80% (red line) for wavelengths in the range of 300 900 nm. 240 Joule 4, 235246, January 15, 2020 the large surface area of the microhole arrays. A 70-nm-thick SiNx anti-reﬂection layer was deposited on the device using plasma-enhanced chemical deposition (PECVD) to maximize light absorption in the appropriate region. Finally, a 400-nm-thick aluminum (Al) layer was deposited on the entire rear surface of the so- lar cell, which was used as an electrode and rear reﬂector to maximize light absorp- tion. The fabricated solar cells showed almost the same transmittances as bare trans- parent c-Si substrates and still appeared neutral colored (Figures 4B and S11). This is because the microhole region, which is the light transmission area, was not shielded during the process of fabricating the solar cell. We quantiﬁed perceptions of the co- lor of the transparent c-Si solar cells using the CIE 1931 chromaticity diagram repre- senting human visual color perception. As shown in Figure 4C, the corresponding coordinates of the devices with transmittances of 20%, 30%, 40%, and 50% were (0.3115 and 0.3285), (0.3103 and 0.3260), (0.3112 and 0.3264), and (0.3105 and 0.3262), respectively. The colors of all transparent c-Si solar cells were perceived to be close to the standard daylight illuminant D65 (0.3127 and 0.3290). To the best of our knowledge, these are the ﬁrst c-Si-based neutral-colored transparent so- lar cells. Although light-transmissive c-Si solar cells have been previously reported, they are not considered transparent solar cells in a strict sense.1921 In such solar cells, only small square-shaped apertures are formed in a certain area of the conven- tional solar cells without considering the invisible conditions of apertures, resulting in opaque regions and apertures being inevitably recognized. However, the trans- parent solar cells developed in this study are entirely transparent because we de- signed an optimized structure such that all the structures of the transparent solar cell are invisible.

(F) Comparison of power conversion efﬁciency achieved in this study and previously reported neutral-colored transparent photovoltaics. Joule 4, 235246, January 15, 2020 241 To evaluate the photovoltaic characteristics of the transparent c-Si solar cells, the current density-voltage (J-V) was measured at an illumination of AM 1.5 G (Fig- ure 4D). The solar cells showed a 12.2% PCE with a transmittance of 20%, Voc of 588 mV, Jsc of 29.2 mA/cm2, and FF of 71.1%. The Jsc of the devices can be recon- ﬁrmed by the external quantum efﬁciency (EQE) (Figures 4E and S12; Table S1). The photovoltaic parameters are presented in Table 1. The cell performances are higher than those of other neutral colored2227 and most of the colored semi-trans- parent solar cells reported thus far (Figures 4F and S13; Table S2). The unprece- dented performances of the transparent c-Si solar cells are mainly owing to the high- ly efﬁcient Jsc, which is quite close to the fundamental limit (Shockley-Queisser limit),28,29 as given below. The fundamental Jsc is deﬁned by the absorptivity (a)30,31: JSC = q Z N 0 aðEÞFSðEÞdE; (Equation 3) where q and FS(E) are the elementary charge and solar spectrum, respectively. In this study, a was approximated using the Lambertian limit,29,32 which was multiplied by the ﬁlling fraction of c-Si. This is because the 200-mm thickness of the ﬂat c-Si area can ensure full absorption of the entire solar spectrum, even via a single path, as already shown in Figures 3 and S5. Thus, the fundamental Jsc limit should be propor- tional to the ﬁlling fraction of c-Si. As shown in Figure S14, the experimentally ob- tained Jsc value (29.2 mA/cm2 with 20% transmittance) agreed well with the funda- mental limit (31.94 mA/cm2 with 20% transmittance), conﬁrming that the transparent c-Si solar cells can indeed closely approach the fundamental absorption limit. To further clarify the prospect of the proposed transparent c-Si solar cells, detailed Shockley-Queisser limit analysis (detailed balance analysis) was carried out (see the Experimental Procedures), and the results together with in-depth anal- ysis are summarized in the Supplemental Information. Transparent c-Si solar cells not only have a high PCE, but they are also expected to be as stable as commercial c-Si solar cells because the former utilize the same struc- ture as the latter. Compared with other types of transparent solar cells, the proposed transparent solar cells are also expected to be easier to commercialize because the fabrication process of the transparent c-Si solar cells is similar to that of the already commercialized c-Si solar cells, except for the patterning or etching step (see Fig- ure S15). Furthermore, the transparent c-Si solar cells would have advantages when used as a BIPV, which is a representative application. In the case of transparent solar cells on a building window, this issue is more important than that of solar cells on horizontal land because most incident light impinges solar cells at an angle. Therefore, we have measured the relative change in the current density with respect to normal illumination for several incident angles (see Figure S16). For transparent c-Si solar cells, the change in current density for incident angles below approxi- mately 40 was less than 4%, whereas that of the reference cells (conventional planar Table 1.

This is because sunlight would be absorbed on the walls of light transmission windows in the case of the transparent c-Si solar cells. Conclusion In conclusion, we successfully developed a neutral-colored transparent c-Si sub- strate and demonstrated its photovoltaic application. The transparent c-Si substrate shows a completely neutral color without a transmission cut-on wavelength, and its transmittance can be easily tuned by controlling the ﬁlling fraction. Furthermore, a 1 cm2 transparent neutral-colored c-Si solar cell fabricated using this transparent c-Si substrate showed a maximum efﬁciency of 12.2%. Our work would lead to new possibilities of developing transparent devices using c-Si, particularly for appli- cation in photovoltaics. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Fabrication of Neutral-Colored Transparent c-Si Structures The transparent c-Si structures were fabricated using n-type Czochralski Si wafers with a thickness of 200 mm and resistivities of 13 U$cm. Microhole arrays were peri- odically patterned using AZ4330E photoresist (AZ Electronic Materials) via the photolithography process. A 200-nm-thick Al layer was deposited on the photoresist pattern as an etching mask. The microhole-array-patterned c-Si substrates were etched via DRIE (Tegal 200) process with a 1,500 W power source, 100 W stage po- wer, and 45 mTorr gas pressure using source gases SF6 (450 sccm) and C4F8 (200 sccm). After the DRIE process, the Al metal mask was removed using Al etchant (type A) for 5 min at 50C, and a cleaning process was also performed using a piranha solution (a mixture of sulfuric acid [H2SO4] and hydrogen peroxide [H2O2]). Fabrication of Neutral-Colored Transparent Photovoltaics The emitter and BSF layer were formed using the SOD method. First, the phos- phorus source (P509, Filmtronics) was spin coated on a dummy Si wafer. This was then baked on a hot plate at 200C for 20 min to remove the organic solvent. The rear side of the c-Si wafer was placed facing the P509-coated dummy wafer to form a BSF layer. A diffusion doping process was then carried out in a tube furnace in a mixed atmosphere of N2 (500 sccm) and O2 (125 sccm) at 880C. Phosphorus sil- icate glass formed after the SOD diffusion process was removed using buffered ox- ide etchant (BOE). After removing the phosphorus silicate glass, an emitter layer was formed on it using a boron source (B155, Filmtronics). The B155 source was spin coated on a dummy Si wafer and then baked at 200C for 20 min. The front side of the wafer was placed facing the B155-coated dummy wafer. A diffusion doping process was then performed in a tube furnace in an N2 atmosphere (500 sccm) at 860C. Microhole arrays were fabricated on the doped wafer using photolithog- raphy and the DRIE method. A 10-nm-thick Al2O3 layer was deposited on the emitter as a surface passivation layer via ALD (Lucida D100, NCD). Post-annealing of the sample was performed in a tube furnace in an ambient forming gas (4% H2) at tem- peratures of 400C for 30 min. In addition, a 70-nm-thick Si3N4 layer was deposited via plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PEH-600, Sorona) as an anti-reﬂec- tion coating. A photolithography process was carried out using the AZ4330E photo- resist to develop a microgrid electrode as the top electrode. The electrodes on the top and bottom sides were formed by depositing 500 nm of Al with a thermal evap- orator. Finally, the photoresist residue was removed by dipping in acetone solution. The wafers were then diced into individual devices measuring 1 3 1 cm using a dicing saw (AR06DM, Aaron). The area of the fabricated transparent c-Si solar cells was 1 cm2. The area of the solar cells is the total area, including the microhole areas. Joule 4, 235246, January 15, 2020 243 Characterization of the Transparent c-Si Solar Cells The photovoltaic properties of the solar cells were investigated using a solar simulator (Class AAA, Oriel Sol3A, Newport) under AM 1.5 G illumination. The incident ﬂux was measured using a calibrated power meter and double-checked using a National Renew- able Energy Laboratory (NREL)-calibrated solar cell (PV Measurements). The solar cells were measured from 1.0 to 1.0 V at a temperature of 25C in air using a voltage scan rate of 380 mV/s. The EQE spectra were measured using a Xe light source and a mono- chromator in the wavelength range of 4001,100 nm. Optical reﬂection measurements were conducted over these wavelengths using a UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer (Cray 5000, Agilent) equipped with a 110-nm integrating sphere to account for total light (diffuse and specular). The color coordinates of the transparent c-Si solar cells were measured using a color-difference meter (CR-20 Color Reader, KONICA MINOLTA). Full 3D Electromagnetic Numerical Simulation of c-Si Nanophotonic diffraction behavior (Figures 2 and S2) and transmittance (Figure S7) were calculated via full 3D electromagnetic numerical simulation. FDTD or FEM, supported by a commercial package (CST Microwavestudio 2014), was used; the dielectric constants of the c-Si used in the numerical calculation were taken from the experimental results. As in the experimental results, 200-mm-thick c-Si was em- ployed in the simulation model; periodic boundary conditions and a perfect matched layer (PML) were implemented. Detailed Balance Analysis of Transparent c-Si Solar Cells We performed a detailed analysis of the balance limit using an approximation of the Lambertian light absorption limit (Equation 3). Instead of an ideal mirror, we used a real- istic Al ﬂat mirror with a reﬂection of 90% and the solar irradiation was AM 1.5 G. CAuger and the intrinsic carrier density (ni) were assumed to be 1.4e30 cm6/s and 8.6e9 cm3, respectively. Both values were taken from the literature.33,34 A collective set of Jsc, Voc, and hext was obtained by working out Equations 3, S5, and S6. Pesc is deﬁned as follows: Pesc = R N 0 paFBBdE R N 0 4pn2 r adFBBdE ; where nr, FBB, and d are the refractive index of c-Si, spectral density of the blackbody radiation, and thickness of the solar cell, respectively.31,35 FBB is deﬁned as follows based on the Boltzmann approximation: FBB ðEÞ = 2E2 h3c2eE=kT; where h and c are the Plank constant and the speed of light, respectively.31,35 In addition, we assumed an unperfected back mirror; thus, non-zero Ppar penalty was taken into account: Ppar = Pesc 3 nrð1  RÞ; where R is the reﬂectivity. In general, a ﬂat Al layer has a reﬂectivity of approximately 90%. The FF in Table S4 was calculated by following the current density-voltage rela- tion of a solar cell: JtotalðVÞ = Jsc  JradðVÞ  JAugerðVÞ  JSRHðVÞ; where Jtotal is the total current density of the solar cell. The recombination rates consid- ered were radiative recombination (Jrad), Auger recombination (JAuger), and Shockley- Read-Hall recombination (JSRH). Those recombination rates are deﬁned as follows: JradðVÞ = qpe qV kT Z N 0 aðEÞFBBðEÞdE: 244 Joule 4, 235246, January 15, 2020 JAugerðVÞ = qe 3qV 2kT CAugern3 i d: JSRHðVÞ = qe qV 2kT 1 tn3 i d: SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION Supplemental Information can be found online at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joule. 2019.11.008.
