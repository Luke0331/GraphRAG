Ong1,2,3, Thomas Allen4, Carolin M. Sutter-Fella1,2,3, Teresa Chen6, Hiroki Ota1,2,3, Ethan W. Schaler1, Stefaan De Wolf5, Christophe Ballif5, Andrés Cuevas4 and Ali Javey1,2,3* A salient characteristic of solar cells is their ability to subject photo-generated electrons and holes to pathways of asymmetrical conductivityassisting them towards their respective contacts. All commercially available crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar cells achieve this by making use of doping in either near-surface regions or overlying silicon-based ﬁlms. Despite being commonplace, this approach is hindered by several optoelectronic losses and technological limitations speciﬁc to doped silicon. A progressive approach to circumvent these issues involves the replacement of doped-silicon contacts with alternative materials which can also form carrier-selective interfaces on c-Si. Here we successfully develop and implement dopant-free electron and hole carrier-selective heterocontacts using alkali metal ﬂuorides and metal oxides, respectively, in combination with passivating intrinsic amorphous silicon interlayers, resulting in power conversion eﬃciencies approaching 20%. Furthermore, the simpliﬁed architectures inherent to this approach allow cell fabrication in only seven low-temperature (200 C), lithography-free steps. This is a marked improvement on conventional doped-silicon high-eﬃciency processes, and highlights potential improvements on both sides of the cost-to-performance ratio for c-Si photovoltaics. T he majority of c-Si solar cells within both industry and research laboratories make use of doped homojunctions to separate photo-generated electrons and holes. Researchers tasked with optimizing these doped homojunctions are faced with a myriad of interrelated optical, carrier transport and recombination based losses, most notably parasitic absorption1, Auger recombination and other heavy doping eﬀects2,3 (for details see Supplementary Table 1). In addition, technological complexities associated with doping, such as high processing temperatures (800 C, with a concomitant necessity for cleanliness), small contact fractions (0.5%), dopant glass removal and junction isolation must be considered4,5. These issues can be partially alleviated by switching to architectures which instead use a set of asymmetric carrier-selective heterocontactsa strategy that has long been considered a crucial technological step to attaining the intrinsic eﬃciency limit of c-Si (ref. 6). Carrier- selective heterocontacts provide a negligible resistance to the collected carrier (synonymous with a low contact resistivity) whilst simultaneously blocking the other carrier (equivalent to low contact recombination). This can be achieved through a number of possible mechanisms at the heterocontactfor example using surface passivating layers or stacks which provide conductivity asymmetry through band oﬀsets, tunnelling probabilities or band bending when applied to c-Si (ref. 7). In recent years, the benefits of the asymmetric heterocontact concept have been realized, perhaps most famously by the silicon heterojunction cell architecture (SHJ, sometimes called HIT, heterojunction with intrinsic thin layer), which has now overtaken its homojunction counterpart in terms of eﬃciency, claiming the world record for c-Si in 2014 (ref. 8). Nonetheless, thus far, all competitive demonstrations of asymmetric heterocontacts911, including the SHJ technology, still rely on doped-silicon layers, which introduce complex deposition optimizations and parasitic optical losses1214. A further advancement of the asymmetric carrier- selective heterocontact concept is to completely replace doped- silicon layers with alternative materials which do not incur the same fundamental limitations and practical diﬃculties, as has been realized on amorphous silicon absorber cells previously15. Several such carrier-selective materials have now been demonstrated on c-Si, including transition metal oxides1619, organic films2022 and metalinsulator structures (used in metalinsulatorsemiconductor inversion layer solar cells)2325, many of which were previously implemented in other absorber-type solar cells15,2628. In contrast to the limitations of doped-silicon regions and layers, the use of diﬀerent carrier-selective materials opens a wider optical and electrical parameter space, decoupling the optimization of diﬀerent solar cell components. Furthermore, they can generally be deposited using simpler techniques (evaporation, spin coating, spray pyrolysis and so on), at low temperaturespotentially reducing the cost and complexity of fabrication. Nevertheless, as it stands, c-Si solar cells implementing a set of dopant-free asymmetric heterocontacts (DASH cells) have been limited to eﬃciencies less than 14% (refs 2932), hindered mostly by carrier recombination losses at the heterointerface with c-Si.

By addressing surface recombination using passivating interlayers, proof-of-concept cells with open-circuit voltages in excess of 700 mV and conversion eﬃciencies close to 20% have been demonstrated. These developments promote the DASH cell approach into the realm of competitive c-Si cell architectures. DASH cell concept Figure 1 outlines the conceptual structure of the DASH c-Si solar cell explored in this work. In this instance, as in the SHJ cell, thin passivating intrinsic hydrogenated amorphous silicon a-Si:H(i) films are implemented on both sides of the wafer. Unlike doped a-Si:H films, which result in 100% parasitic absorption, these less-defective intrinsic thin films contribute some current to the solar cell12. More importantly these layers greatly reduce the carrier recombination rate at the c-Si surface, enabling a high excess carrier concentration under illumination, essential for a high solar cell operating voltage. Such layers must be kept suﬃciently thin to avoid excessive resistance and absorption losses12. We note these a-Si:H(i) films are not integral to the DASH concept and could be replaced in the future with other non-absorbing or higher-lifetime organic or inorganic passivating films. On top of the thin passivating layer electron-selective and hole-selective materials are deposited on opposite wafer surfaces. In contrast to the SHJ process, rather than using doped a-Si:H films, in this study transparent materials with extreme work-function values are chosen to achieve carrier selectivity. Ideally, when a material with a very low work function is applied to lightly doped c-Si, accumulation of electrons (and repulsion of holes) occurs near the surface. This high concentration of surface electrons reduces the heterocontact resistivity and the corresponding low hole surface concentration reduces the probability of ShockleyReadHall recombination at the heterocontact interface. The corollary holds for holes and high-work-function materials. In this manner, by placing materials with an extreme work-function diﬀerence on either side of a c-Si wafer, eﬃcient separation of photo-generated carriers can be achieved. Finally, the remaining supporting structures (transparent conductive oxide and metal contacts) are depositedenabling optimal light coupling into the cell and low resistive losses for photo- generated carriers en route to the external circuit. Central to the DASH cell concept is the functionality of the carrier-selective heterocontacts. For the hole-selective side, we previously developed an a-Si:H(i)/molybdenum oxide MoOx-based contact to c-Si which owes its hole selectivity to the very large work function of MoOx (refs 17,33). Such a structure has recently been demonstrated to be compatible with eﬃciencies above 22% (ref. 34). However, a dopant-free electron-selective heterocontact with an equivalent level of performance has yet to be demonstrated. A group of proven electron-selective materials, frequently used in organic devices, is that formed by the alkali and alkaline earth metal salts. These materials consist of a metal cation from groups 1 or 2 of the periodic table ionically bonded to diﬀerent anions, such as carbonate35, acetate36 or halogens3638. Although there still exists some contention as to the mechanism of the high electron conductivity across this interface3537, most studies attribute the formation of a low-work-function electrode as the most important consequence. Of particular interest within this group of materials are the alkali metal fluorides (AMFs). Thermally evaporated AMFs are explored here as a novel component, complementary to MoOx, for c-Si solar cells. Such a combination has been implemented on 2  2016 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Three representative AMFs (LiFx, KFx and CsFx) are studied to identify which presents the best contact properties to c-Si. Optoelectronic properties of carrier-selective materials As discussed above, the work function of the carrier-selective materials can play a crucial role in the eﬃcacy of the DASH cell approach. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) secondary electron cutoﬀanalysis presented in Fig. 2a shows very low work-function values of the LiFx/Al, KFx/Al and CsFx/Al interfaces, measured to be 2.86, 2.46 and 2.61 eV, respectively. Provided in the same plot is the previously measured value of 5.7 eV for the high-work-function material MoOx (ref. 17), demonstrating the desired extreme work-function separation as discussed above. A unique advantage of dopant-free heterocontacts is the ability to separately tune their optical and electronic impact on the solar cell. A Tauc plot for LiFx, KFx, CsFx and MoOx, films is provided in Fig. 2b, alongside the AM 1.5G spectrum, to evaluate the significance of their absorption. Also included in this Tauc plot are trends for phosphorus- and boron-doped a-Si:H, which are typically implemented as 10 nm films in standard doped-silicon SHJ cells39. It can be seen that the MoOx and AMF films exhibit higher transparency across the spectrum than the conventional doped a-Si:H layers. The Tauc energy gap ETauc of the AMFs is greater than the measurement range (6.8 eV), resulting in negligible absorption, whereas MoOx films exhibit an Etauc of 3.3 eV, resulting in minor absorption of high-energy light (where the Suns irradiance is relatively low). Ray tracing simulations reveal that compared to the SHJ cells doped-silicon heterocontacts, a reduction in front- film parasitic absorption of 1 mA cm2 could be achieved by switching to an optimized dopant-free heterocontact cell design (see Supplementary Note 1 and Fig. 1). In addition, core level and valence band XPS analyses of LiFx and MoOx films are shown in Fig. 2c. The valence band of the LiFx is measured to be 6.6 eV from the Fermi energy and shows no clear sub-band features despite the reduced component suggested by the shape of the Li 1s peaks. The MoOx valence band and core levels are in alignment with those previously measured for evaporated films, showing the clear formation of a sub-band peak originating from a reduced MoOx state that has demonstrated importance for its carrier-selective function17. Extractions of the film stoichiometry based on core level peak areas also support a slightly reduced cation oxidation state for both LiFx and MoOx films.

Electron heterocontact development Whereas the electrical contact properties of MoOx-based hole- selective heterocontacts on c-Si have previously been character- ized and shown to be promising for c-Si solar cells1719,33,34,40, the application of AMF/Al electron-selective contacts in c-Si solar cells remains relatively unexplored32,41. Figure 3a shows that the contact resistivity ρc for LiFx/Al (blue), KFx/Al (red) and CsFx/Al (orange) to moderately doped n-type (N d 5  1015 cm3) c-Si has a strong dependence on the AMF interlayer thickness, with all three mate- rials producing the lowest ρc values in the 0.51.5 nm range. The lowest extracted values of 1 m cm2 for the LiFx/Al and CsFx/Al contacts are at the limit of the measurement resolution, representing an upper limit ρc (for details see Supplementary Note 2). Such values are exceptionally low, given the well-known diﬃculties of con- tacting moderate resistivity n-type c-Sian issue associated with Fermi level pinning and the position of silicons charge neutrality level close to the valence band42. This introduces the possibility of previously unattainable cell architecturesfor example, n-type undiﬀused partial rear contact cells. The measured stability of these electron-selective contacts in both air (filled markers) and argon (open markers) is provided in Fig. 3b. An increase in ρc for CsFx- based and KFx-based contacts is seen within the first 24 h of air exposure. This increase is slowed by more than an order of mag- nitude as a result of storing the samples in argon ambient. The LiFx electron-selective contact, however, exhibits exceptional longevity, with negligible degradation over 1,000 h in both environments, and is therefore used in the DASH cells presented in this work. A high rate of recombination at the c-Si/LiFx interface precludes the direct implementation of full-area LiFx/Al electron-selective contacts into solar cells (for details see Supplementary Note 2). This issue can be amended by the addition of a thin passivating interlayer between the c-Si and LiFx/Al stack. As shown in Fig. 3d, two potential candidates for passivating the c-Si surface are hydrogenated amorphous silicon a-Si:H(i) (as used in the SHJ cell) and titanium oxide TiOx (refs 16,30). Both of these films greatly reduce the c-Si surface recombination rate, allowing a high implied open-circuit voltage V oc around 700 mV, in line with state-of-the-art surface passivation (for details see Supplementary Note 2). Figure 3c shows the dependence of ρc on LiFx thickness for n-type wafers passivated with 6 nm TiOx (purple) or a-Si:H(i) (green) films. Clear improvements in electron selectivity seen with the addition of the LiFx/Al contact for these disparate passivation strategies highlight the versatility of this approach. Optimum ρc values of 500 and 7 m cm2 are found for the TiOx/LiFx/Al and a-Si:H(i)/LiFx/Al heterocontacts, respectively, both with a LiFx interlayer thickness of 1 nm. These two values fall at the upper and lower ends of an equivalent ρc range reported in the literature for doped- silicon-based heterocontacts43,44. Simulating these contacts within an idealized solar cell indicates that both systems could be eﬀectively applied as full-area electron heterocontacts and that devices implementing a-Si:H(i) interlayers will produce higher eﬃciencies (for details see Supplementary Note 3 and Supplementary Fig. 4). High-eﬃciency proof-of-concept DASH cells Finally, high-eﬃciency DASH cells implementing a-Si:H(i)/LiFx/Al and a-Si:H(i)/MoOx heterocontacts were fabricated.

The Jsc obtained from the external quantum eﬃciency, shown above a photograph of the DASH cell, agrees well with that measured from the light JV analysis. Texturing is employed to enhance both the amount of light coupled into the cell and the path length of that light once inside the cell. Of notable benefit in this cell architecture is the fabrication procedure, requiring just seven low-temperature steps without the use of complex alignment or photolithography. This oﬀers a significant simplification over dopant-diﬀused high-eﬃciency architectures, which involve 20 steps and a high thermal budget45. The simple, room-temperature deposition of dopant-free selective layers also potentially introduces benefits over doped a-Si:H layers, used in SHJ cells, which are typically deposited at 200 C using toxic gases and require precise condition control to balance trade-oﬀs between J sc, V oc and fill factor based losses1214. Light JV measurements provided in Fig. 4b show that power conversion eﬃciencies η of up to 19.4% have been achieved in the early stages of this DASH cell development, enabled by V oc, J sc and fill factor values of 716 mV, 37.07 mA cm2 and 73.15%, respectively. The statistics of the champion cell batch reveal a tight spread in results, with an average eﬃciency above 19%, a testament to the reproducibility of this DASH cell design (see Supplementary Table 2). An accompanying spectral response analysis, shown in Fig. 4c, reveals a high quantum collection eﬃciency over most of the AM1.5G spectrum (see Supplementary Fig. 5 and Supplementary Note 4 for further DASH cell characterization). An enhancement in the rear-side reflection and a reduction in the series resistance of the DASH cell are identified as the two most likely paths towards higher eﬃciency for this design. An improvement in J sc of 1 mA cm2 could arise by replacing Al with Ag (or possibly ITO), and a boost in the fill factor above 79% could occur by further reducing the resistive loses, as detailed in the Supplementary Note 4. It is envisaged that future iterations of this DASH approach could be combined with even lower thermal budget processingintegrating amorphous transparent conductive oxides46,47, plating metalliza- tion34 and low-cost, low-temperature back-end processing48. Conclusions In this work we have demonstrated the DASH cell concepta simple, low-temperature c-Si solar cell featuring dopant-free heterocontactswith high power conversion eﬃciency. A key enabling factor is the development of a novel c-Si/a-Si:H(i)/LiFx/Al electron-selective heterocontact to complement the recently developed a-Si:H(i)/MoOx hole-selective heterocontact. Proof-of- concept device eﬃciencies approaching 20% have been achieved, supported by a high V oc and low contact resistance at both heterocontacts. This represents a significant improvement on NATURE ENERGY | VOL 1 | MARCH 2016 | www.nature.com/natureenergy  2016 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

The versatility and simplicity of the DASH approach can also potentially benefit more advanced solar cell architectures. In particular, dopant-free interdigitated back contact or dopant-free bifacial (using, for example, LiFx/transparent conductive oxide contacts) solar cells are both logical extensions of this work. The advancement past the limitations of single-junction c-Si cells could also be facilitated using dopant-free carrier-selective contacts for a c-Si bottom cell in a monolithic tandem-cell structure. Put simply, the above- developed DASH system can eﬀectively be viewed as a toolbox for a wide range of c-Si solar cell architectures, providing opportunities for facile fabrication of high-eﬃciency device structures at low temperatures. Methods Carrier-selective materials (LiFx, KFx, CsFx, MoOx) used in this study were deposited by vacuum thermal evaporation from powder sources (3 N purity). Controlled deposition rates of 0.251 Å s1 (as monitored by a crystal oscillator) were used at a base pressure of 5  106 mbar. Materials characterization. For XPS characterization, thin films of LiFx, KFx, CsFx, MoOx or Al (or combinations thereof) were deposited on polished c-Si wafers. A Kratos AXIS Ultra DLD system with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source and a hemispherical analyser was used for the measurements. Secondary electron cutoﬀand valence band measurements were performed using X-ray excitation, with an added bias to extract the cutoﬀedge. Linear fits from the respective edges were used to extract numerical values for Ef Ev (at the valence band edge) and the work functions of the AMF/Al interfaces. For the valence band measurements, thin layers of the final implemented contact materials (MoOx and LiFx) were characterized directly on as-evaporated c-Si substrates to reveal the electronic structure near the valence band edge. Work functions were extracted from evaporated AMF/Al bilayers, with the Al thinned down to 5 nm by Ar ion milling (4 kV) in situ to observe the work-function modification of the Al contact overlayer by the diﬀerent AMFs. A Au reference work function at 5.2 eV was measured in the same measurement session, confirming the accuracy of measurements. The core level spectra were fitted using the commonly applied Voigtian peak shapes and Shirley background correction to extract the stoichiometry of the contact layers by the ratio of scaled peak areas. Peak areas were extracted from the background corrected Voigt fits of Li 1s, F 1s, Mo 3d and O 1s spectra presented in Fig. 2, and scaled by their relative atomic sensitivity factors49 (normalized to F 1s). As expected, owing to the decomposition of these materials during the evaporation process, the MoOx contact layer achieves a value of x approximately 2.87 (after accounting for the carbon-related oxygen contaminant peak commonly seen in O 1s levels for MoOx films50), and the LiFx contact layer is measured to have an x value of approximately 0.91, representing slightly sub-stoichiometric films in both cases. For the LiFx material, a sub-stoichiometric film is observed due to the presence of a reduced Li(0) peak, also observed in previous XPS measurements on LiFx (ref. 51). The MoOx Mo 3d level indicates both the 6+ and 5+ oxidation states as in previous explorations of evaporated films17, a feature attributed to the formation of the defect band in as-evaporated MoOx films. Absorbance measurements were performed on transparent substrates with thin films of LiFx, KFx, CsFx and MoOx on one side (CaF2 substrates were used for the AMFs and quartz was used for the MoOx). Measurements were taken using a N2-purged spectrophotometer (Cary 5000 UVVisNIR spectrophotometer). Contact structure and measurement. The c-Si(n)/AMF/Al electron-selective contacts were fabricated on planar, n-type (N d 5  1015 cm3), float zone (FZ), c-Si wafers with a thickness of 200 µm. These were subjected to a dilute HF dip before evaporation of the contact structures. A full-area stack consisting of 1.5 nm of AMF and 250 nm of Al was evaporated on the rear side of the contact structures without breaking vacuum. An array of diﬀerent diameter circles was evaporated on the front of the test structures by means of a shadow mask. These circles were deposited as a stack of variable thicknesses of AMF capped with 250 nm of Al, and ρc was extracted as described in Supplementary Note 2 and Supplementary Fig. 2. For the interlayer contact study, hydrogenated amorphous silicon films of 6 nm were deposited by means of plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD) at 200 C on pyramidal textured, FZ, n-type (N d 1  1015 cm3) c-Si wafers. Titanium oxide films of 6 nm were deposited on planar, FZ, n-type (N d 5  1015 cm3), c-Si wafers by means of atomic layer deposition (ALD) at 230 C using alternating pulses of titanium isopropoxide and water (growth rate of 0.03 nm/cycle). Both sets of samples received standard RCA cleaning and dilute HF dips immediately before deposition (see Supplementary Note 2 and Supplementary Fig. 3 for details on the passivating interlayers). Contact structures were fabricated and ρc was extracted as above. The minor diﬀerence in doping concentration is not expected to significantly aﬀect the measured ρc. Solar cell structure and measurement. High-eﬃciency cells (2  2 cm2) were fabricated on double-side pyramidal textured, FZ, n-type (N d 1  1015 cm3) wafers with a thickness of 240 µm. Following standard RCA cleaning and a dilute HF dip, the cells were passivated on both sides with a 6 nm intrinsic a-Si:H(i) layer, grown at 200 C by means of PECVD in an Octopus I reactor from INDEOtec SA. On the front side of the cell, 10 nm of MoOx was thermally evaporated, on top of which a bilayer consisting of 55 nm of hydrogenated indium oxide and 10 nm of ITO was sputtered (MRC 603) at room temperature through a 2  2 cm2 shadow mask to define the cell area. A screen-printed Ag front grid with a corresponding contact fraction of 5% was printed and baked at 130 C. Following this, on the rear side, an 1 nm LiFx/ 100 nm Al stack was evaporated without breaking vacuum. Cross-sectional scanning electron micrographs were taken on a Zeiss Gemini Ultra-55. Light JV characteristics were measured under standard 1 sun conditions (AM 1.5G spectrum, 100 mW cm2, 25 C) with a Wacom solar simulator, and EQE was measured using an in-house built set-up.
