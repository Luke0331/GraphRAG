REVIEW www.global-challenges.com Innovative Strategies for Photons Management on Ultrathin Silicon Solar Cells Ning Li and Andrea Fratalocchi* Silicon (Si), the eighth most common element in the known universe by mass and widely applied in the industry of electronics chips and solar cells, rarely emerges as a pure element in the Earths crust. Optimizing its manufacturing can be crucial in the global challenge of reducing the cost of renewable energy modules and implementing sustainable development goals in the future. In the industry of solar cells, this challenge is stimulating studies of ultrathin Si-based architectures, which are rapidly attracting broad attention. Ultrathin solar cells require up to two orders of magnitude less Si than conventional solar cells, and owning to a Ô¨Çexible nature, they are opening applications in diÔ¨Äerent industries that conventional cells do not yet serve. Despite these attractive factors, a diÔ¨Éculty in ultrathin Si solar cells is overcoming the weak light absorption at near-infrared wavelengths. The primary goal in addressing this problem is scaling up cost-eÔ¨Äective and innovative textures for anti-reÔ¨Çection and light-trapping with shallower depth junctions, which can oÔ¨Äer similar performances to traditional thick modules. This review provides an overview of this area of research, discussing this Ô¨Åeld both as science and engineering and highlighting present progress and future outlooks. 1. Introduction The cost of photovoltaic (PV) power has rapidly fallen in recnt years, with an average upfront expenditure for a residential solar system between 3500 $ and 16000 $.[1] Despite this Ô¨Ågure be- ing almost one-third less expensive than the most economical option of fossil fuel,[2] the industry of silicon (Si) solar cells still has ample opportunities for improvement in the area of mate- rial processing and manufacturing.[3, 4] In recent years, ultrathin crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar cells have attracted signiÔ¨Åcant inter- est as promising candidates to further reduce costs owing to their compact size.[57] Amorphous Si (a-Si) is also a choice for manu- facturing ultrathin Si solar cells.[8] However, the higher bandgap N.

Unlike conventional modules possessing 160 Œºm180 Œºm thickness commonly used in PV systems, these ultrathin Si solar cells enable a tenfold decrease in the wafer thickness, reach- ing values below 20 Œºm in Si devices.[9] Table 1 summarizes the previous works about ultrathin Si solar cells within the last 15 years. These cells oÔ¨Äer an en- couraging pathway to implement the next generation of cost-competitive PV systems that, without subsidies, could lower the price of single modules below 0.5 $/W in the future.[10] Because of their reduced thickness and increased Ô¨Çexibil- ity, ultrathin cells can also extend the ap- plications panorama of PV in aerospace, transportation, sensing, computing, and wearable electronics that conventional PV does not yet address.[11] While research estimates that ultra- thin cells with thicknesses down to 10 Œºm can reach eÔ¨Éciencies up to 28.5%[12, 13] and comparable to con- ventional c-Si solar cells,[9, 14] a global challenge for ultrathin cells is absorbing near-infrared (NIR) light from a single pass of long wavelengths in the cells absorber. Addressing this problem re- quires developing innovative broadband anti-reÔ¨Çection coatings (ARCs) and eÔ¨Écient light-trapping techniques to increase the ef- fective optical path length inside the structure.[15] Researchers explored diÔ¨Äerent ARC structures manufactured with industri- ally scalable wet-chemistry techniques ranging from inverted pyramid,[16, 17] upright nanopyramid,[18] nanowires,[19] and dual structures,[20] reaching power conversion eÔ¨Éciency (PCE) as high as 16.4% from solar cells with wafer thickness as low as 16 Œºm.[16] Adding nanoparticles at the solar cells rear side is also a strategy studied to scatter the light at an increasing opti- cal path.[8, 21] A central diÔ¨Éculty in all these methods originates from the fact that structured surfaces demand deeper junctions, accompanied by more severe carrier recombination losses.[22] To address this issue, researchers recently proposed more elaborate structures surface,[23, 24] in which a single ARC simultaneously provides in- creased light absorption and light scattering management. While this strategy allows reducing the cell thickness below 3 Œºm, the manufacturing processes of these advanced ARCs require time- consuming and expensive e-beam nanolithography techniques that are not rapidly scalable as wet-chemistry.

The calculation assumes single-pass absorp- tion into a Ô¨Çat Si layer with no light path enhancement.[25] The Ô¨Ågure illustrates quantitatively the challenge of absorbing sun- light with ultra-thin designs, which fail to capture the most in- tense part of the solar power density spectrum from the visible to the near-infrared (Figure 1, blue solid line). In general, the current eÔ¨Éciency of 10 Œºm thickness thin solar cells lies around 15%, which is 5%10% away from the current eÔ¨Éciency of con- ventionally thick Si solar cells.[2630] Such a performance gap of- fers signiÔ¨Åcant research opportunities. It deÔ¨Ånes the challenge of engineering a cost-eÔ¨Äective structural scaling while maintaining eÔ¨Écient light absorption in ultrathin modules. This review sum- marizes recent works in this direction. It discusses ultrathin Si solar cells and the latest generation of Si-polymer hybrid hetero- junctions, analyzing optical mechanisms of light management and their manufacturing processes. Figure 1.

We report the solar power density spectrum for reference in the solid blue line. 2. Dielectric Nanostructuring Technologies Research groups are currently exploring diverse strategies to fab- ricate light management textures on ultrathin solar cells made of Si, ranging from wet chemical etching,[31, 32] dry etching,[33, 34] e-beam nanolithography[24] and nanoimprinting.[3538] In the work,[31] Branham et al. propose a periodic inverted pyramid tex- ture fabricated by potassium hydroxide (KOH) wet chemistry etching technique on a 10 Œºm p-type Si as a base substrate. KOH wet chemistry etching produces atomically smooth sur- faces when forming surface periodic structures, minimizing the creation of unnecessary defects with detrimental recombination sites.[39] Figure 2a,b shows the schematic and SEM image of the solar cell. The pyramids in ref. [31] possess a sloping angle of 54.7 and a 700 nm separation length between the centers of two adjacent elements (Figure 2b). The proposed device employs a 100 nm thick Si3N4 passivation layer for assisting light-trapping at the surface. On the rear side, the cell uses a 250 nm SiO2 passivation layer for the Si, and a 600 nm thick Aluminum (Al) Ô¨Ålm working as both electrode and mirror to enhance light-trapping further. This work tests two implementations, A and B, of the same de- vice structure. Figure 2c shows the light absorption of these de- vices. The measurements report that the inverted pyramid textur- ing reaches absorption larger than 90% in the wavelength range from 400 to 920 nm. In the NIR region, the device presents in- creased light absorption of 10% compared to earlier results.[5, 40] The authors compare the NIR absorption to a Lambertian ref- erence (dashed black line in Figure 2c) and observe that the in- verted pyramid provides, on average, 30% higher absorption (red and green lines in Figure 2c). This work uses the transfer matrix method to simulate parasitic Al absorption, which shows that the Al back reÔ¨Çector (dashed blue line in Figure 2c) contributes 13% of the measured absorption at the wavelength of ùúÜ= 1100 nm. This theoretical Ô¨Ånding implies that optimizing the back reÔ¨Çec- tion could signiÔ¨Åcantly enhance the device absorption on the front panel. The authors report the external quantum eÔ¨Éciency (EQE) and current density-voltage measurements to assess the impact of Global Challenges. 2024, 8, 2300306  2024 The Authors.

In the wavelength range from 440 to 850 nm, the EQE of A and B devices exceeds 80% (Figure 2d), which is comparable to the performances of 200 300 Œºm thick Si solar cell.[28, 41] Con- versely, the EQE decreases sharply for wavelengths shorter than 450 nm (Figure 2d). The authors attribute this eÔ¨Äect to surface Auger recombination within a heavily doped n-type emitter that absorbs high-energy photons. In the wavelength beyond 850 nm, the EQE of A and B drops below 80%, falling rapidly after 970 nm (Figure 2d), resulting from the parasitic photon absorption in Al and Si nitride. Figure 2e assesses the Ô¨Ånal device performance by reporting device A and Bs current densityvoltage characteristics com- pared to a planar reference. The implementation B holds a JSC of 34.5 mA cm2, which is 5 mA cm2 lower than the theoreti- cal performance of of 39.6 mA cm2 possessed by a 10 Œºm thick Lambertian absorber. The resulting eÔ¨Éciency of this device is 15.4%. Conversely, implementation A shows a lower current of 33.9 mA cm2. However, thanks to a superior FF of 78.5%, de- vice A reaches a similar eÔ¨Éciency of 15.7% (Figure 2e). In both devices, the VOC lies in the range of 590 mV (Figure 2e). This value is lower than previously reported results,[5, 22, 42] oÔ¨Äering space for optimization in future work. Following a similar research direction, Gaucher et al. presents an inverted pyramid texture on a solar cell with 3 Œºm thick c-Si epitaxial layers.[32] Figure 3a shows the schematic of the designed solar cell. In this work,[32] the KOH wet etching yields inverted pyramids with patterned Si fabricated by a chromium hard mask and Soft UV nanoimprint lithography technique. Figure 3b illus- trates the SEM image of the solar cell device. The inverted pyra- mid structures are arranged regularly with a depth of 330 nm. Figure 3c reports the current-voltage characterization of the pla- nar and patterned solar cells. At the beginning of the fabrication process in ref. [32], the starting c-Si thickness in the solar cell is d = 3 Œºm. After etching, the equivalent c-Si thickness reduces to deq = 2.75 Œºm. The patterend structure reports a JSC of 25.3 mA cm2, VOC of 440 mV, FF = 0.45, and eÔ¨Éciency of 5%, while the planar control reports a JSC of 18.3 mA cm2, VOC of 490 mV, FF = 0.68, and eÔ¨Éciency of 6.1% (Figure 3c). The texturing proposed by this work reports a 40% enhancement of JSC. However, its eÔ¨Éciency decreases more than 18% because of a lower FF and VOC. This work studies the physical process behind the improve- ment of JSC and the sharp decrease of other performance pa- rameters by analyzing the spectral response of patterned solar cells and planar reference. Figure 3d shows the specular reÔ¨Çec- tivity R plotted as (1  R) of the patterned solar cell (red dashed line), EQE measurements of planar (blue line), patterned solar cells (red line) and double-pass absorption calculated for a Si slab of the same thickness d = 3 Œºm (green line). Figure 3d shows that the EQE values of the patterned solar cell are more signiÔ¨Åcant than the control cell in the entire visible range. This Global Challenges. 2024, 8, 2300306  2024 The Authors.

The work compares these results with theoretical calculations from double pass absorption to further validate this claim. They evaluate the double pass absorption for a back mirror and perfect ARC by using the BeerLambert law: A(ùúÜ) = 1 eùõºFd (1) where F is the enhancement factor of light path, d is the Si layer thickness, ùõº(ùúÜ) is the wavelength-dependent absorption coeÔ¨É- cient for Si, and ùúÜis the wavelength. If the pyramid array is a per- fect ARC layer, the EQE values of the patterned solar cell should become lower and match the prediction from the double-pass absorption model beyond the wavelength of 700 nm. However, the EQE obtained for the patterned solar cell outperforms the predictions from double-pass absorption, implying that the ARC layer improves the devices EQE eÔ¨Éciency. The increase in the JSC (ŒîJSC) from the double-pass absorption and the EQE of the patterned solar cell is 4.4 mA cm2, representing a 63% enhance- ment in the JSC between the planar and patterned solar cell. To further study optical losses in the textured solar cell, the au- thors resort to Ô¨Ånite-diÔ¨Äerent time-domain (FDTD) simulation. Figure 3e shows the absorption of each layer in a patterned solar cell calculated by FDTD. The EQE (black dotted line in Figure 3e) in the patterned solar cell matches well with the theoretical pre- diction (yellow area in Figure 3e). By assuming ideal carriers col- lection from a standard AM1.5G solar spectrum, the authors es- timate the solar cell to generate a 26.6 mA cm2 JSC from light absorption in the c-Si layer. This value matches quite closely the measured JSC of 25.3 mA cm2 (Figure 3c), indicating the pres- ence of small, additional losses from parasitic absorption and car- rier recombination in passivation layers. The authors provide additional modeling on the light-trapping mechanism inside the solar cell to deepen the understanding of these performances. Figure 3f shows the optical model of the so- lar cell used in this work. Figure 3g shows the comparison of the patterned solar cells EQE with the prediction from double-pass absorption with diverse light path enhancement factors (F): F = 2  1.25 from eÔ¨Äective thickness induced by diÔ¨Äraction and F = 2 from a Ô¨Çat reference, and F = 10 from a propagation model. The- oretical results do not match the measured EQE (dashed green line in Figure 3g) in the 626 nm to 1100 nm wavelength range. This work attributes this result to the increased eÔ¨Äective thick- ness resulting from the eÔ¨Écient light-trapping of the cell texture. Figure 3g shows this point quantitatively, matching the EQE pre- diction with a varying enhancement factor from 850 to 1000 nm. The authors estimate the light path enhancement factor F by the normalized eÔ¨Äective thickness deÔ¨Äand the possibility of photons escape Pesc: F = 2 deÔ¨Ä d 1 Pesc (2) with the following parameters deÔ¨Ä/d = 1.25, F = 2  1.25  4 = 10, and Pesc is 0.25.

In a diÔ¨Äerent article,[5] Jeong et al. develops a sub 10 Œºm all- back-contact ultrathin Si solar cell with nanocone textures, which achieves a PCE of 13.7%. Figure 4a shows the devices schematic, with the front side patterned with a light-trapping texture made of nanocones. Figure 4b shows the nanocones SEM image. These nanocones distribute regularly with a height of 400 nm and a di- ameter of 450 nm. Figure 4c shows the EQE of the solar cell (red line with square dots) against the planar control (blue line with circle dots). The EQE of the device is higher than 80% in the wave- length range from 400 to 800 nm and attains a value of 80% at the wavelength of 400 nm. As observed in previous reports, the cell absorbs short wavelengths of light near the surface, where the in- creased loss originates from the augmented surface area due to Auger recombination.[4345] Usually, this process results in EQEs below 50% near the wavelength of 400 nm.[46, 47] However, con- trary to this trend, the nanocone strategy developed in this work leads the solar cell to a record value EQE between 400 and 800 nm wavelengths. The main reason for this enhancement is con- trolling surface area. Ideally, ultrathin Si solar cell textures should minimize the surface area while improving light absorption be- cause larger areas lead to stronger surface losses.[4850] The au- thors of ref. [5] calculate the surface area of nanocone structure, estimating an increase compared to a planar surface of 67%, a value that is a few orders of magnitude lower than the surface area of other reported texturing methods.[22, 51] Figure 4d shows the J V data of the solar cell in this work (red line with square dots) compared against a planar reference (blue line with circle dots). The designed solar cell has a JSC of 29.0 mA cm2, while the planar reference with 80 nm Si3N4 Ô¨Ålm as ARC layer shows a JSC of 22.2 mA cm2. The nanocone tex- ture yields 30.7% enhancement of JSC compared with the planar control. The authors explain this result thanks to the strong light absorption from the front side of the nanocones and the back- contact design, which minimizes charge recombination losses. These two factors interact synergistically to provide a superior EQE performance.[52, 53] Figure 4e shows the theoretical EQE pre- diction of four diÔ¨Äerent 10-Œºm-thick devices obtained by com- puter simulations. In these calculations, when the recombina- tion velocity (S) reaches 100 cm s1, the all-back contact device (red line with circle dots in Figure 4e) generates an EQE of 94% at 400 nm. In contrast, the front-back contact device (black line in Figure 4e) shows a lower EQE of 28%. These calculations indicate that the all-back-contact design provides an additional beneÔ¨Åcial factor that works together with the ARC properties of nanocone texturing in the range of short wavelengths. Figure 4f reports the absorption of 10 Œºm thick Si with nanocone as ARC layer (red line with square dots), 10 Œºm thick planar control with 80 nm thick Si3N4 as ARC layer (blue line with circle dots), and 500 Œºm thick planar control with 80 nm thick Si3N4 as ARC layer (black line). In the wavelength range between 400 and 900 nm, the light absorption of the 10 Œºm thick Si with nanocones reaches 96.1%, reducing to 83.8% in the wave- length of 400 nm and 900 nm (Figure 4f). These values are 28% and 198% higher than the 10 Œºm thick planar control with 80 nm Global Challenges. 2024, 8, 2300306  2024 The Authors.

This ARC strategy shows a comparable light absorption to a 500 Œºm thick planar control with 80 nm thick Si3N4 ARC layer (Figure 4f). The results of this work demonstrate that surface engineering, balancing reÔ¨Çection, and scattering eÔ¨Äects are important factors in enabling optimal per- formances. Recently, Lee et al. propose an eÔ¨Äective photon management strategy by light-trapping ARCs (LARCs) for 2.8 Œºm thick c- Si solar cells,[24] achieving a PCE of 11.2%. Figure 5a shows the schematic design of the ultrathin solar cell used. The sys- tem includes a 2.8 Œºm thick pn junction-based active layer, followed by LARCs on the devices front surface. Figure 5b,c show microscopy and SEM images of the solar cells top surface with a single-nanoblock ARC and a double-nanoblock LARC, re- spectively. The single-nanoblock array has nanostructures with a period of 180 nm, height of 105 nm, and width of 100 nm. The double-nanoblock array, conversely, possesses nanostruc- tures with a period of 450 nm, height of 105 nm, width1 = 100 nm, width2 = 145 nm. The authors use a 25 nm SiO2 layer in both solar cells to passivate the texture conformally. Figure 5d,e show the schematic of the single-nanoblock ar- ray and double-nanoblock array, respectively. The design of the single-nanoblock array follows Mie scattering theory by optimiz- ing broadband ARC eÔ¨Äects (Figure 5d). The single-nanoblock ar- ray evolves into a double-nanoblock array by changing the dimen- sion of every other nanoblock in the array while closely keeping the Ô¨Ålling fraction of Si to 30% (Figure 5e). This optimization maintains the broadband anti-reÔ¨Çection property while improv- ing light-trapping thanks to making the unit-cell period doubled. In Si active layer, this new design opens diÔ¨Äraction channels. Figure 5f reports the experimental J V curves of the best solar cell device with diÔ¨Äerent light management strategies. The re- sulting PCEs are 10.39% for double-nanoblock LARC (red line), 9.41% for single-nanoblock ARC (blue line), 8.53% for conven- tional SiNx ARC (green line), and 6.90 for planar reference with- out an ARC (grey line). The highest PCE of double-nanoblock LARC-based cell measured is 11.22% (orange line). The authors attribute the variance of performances in the diÔ¨Äerent batches to diÔ¨Äerent thicknesses of the seed Si layer. The authors further study the enhancement of the cell per- formances by investigating the optical properties of double- nanoblock LARC design. Figure 5g shows the ultrathin Si solar cells reÔ¨Çectance spectra with single-nanoblock ARC (blue line) and double-nanoblock LARC (red line), SiNx ARC (green line), and without ARC (grey line). Compared with planar control, the design with SiNx ARC shows an eÔ¨Äective suppression near the wavelength of 600 nm with a 12.8% average reÔ¨Çectance. The so- lar cells with single-nanoblock ARC and double-nanoblock LARC show a better anti-reÔ¨Çection than SiNx ARC at shorter wave- lengths. The average reÔ¨Çectance is 7.1% for single-nanoblock Global Challenges. 2024, 8, 2300306  2024 The Authors.

Figure 5h shows the EQE curves of ultrathin solar cells with SiNx ARC (green line), without ARC (grey line), single-nanoblock ARC (blue line) and double-nanoblock LARC (red line). The EQE spectra variation of the solar cells with single-nanoblock ARC, SiNx ARC, and planar reference compare well with re- Ô¨Çectance measurements in Figure 5g. The increased EQE mea- sured from the single-nanoblock ARC results from its broadband anti-reÔ¨Çection, yielding higher EQE than the cell with SiNx ARC in the short wavelength range (Figure 5h). Conversely, the solar cells EQE values with double-nanoblock LARC show superior values all over the spectra compared to all the others (Figure 5h). Figure 5i shows the EQE of the solar cell with double-nanoblock LARC by changing the incident angle from 0 to 60 for s- and p- polarizations. Thanks to the broad angular responses of the Mie resonances, the cell does not exhibit appreciable dependence on the angle. Si-polymer hybrid heterojunction ultrathin Si solar cells, due to a low fabrication cost and high PCE attainable, have attracted large interests in recent years.[19, 5456] The n-type c-Si works as a light-trapping and carrier generation layer in these structures. At the same time, the polymer acts as a hole transport layer. The scalable manufacturing of these cells is economical as it requires spin-coating and direct annealing steps to form Si-polymer het- erojunctions. At the same time, the polymer also functionalizes as a passivation layer to reduce carrier recombination. Because of the limited light absorption into the active c-Si thin Ô¨Ålm layer, designing eÔ¨Écient light-trapping is essential to obtain eÔ¨Écient performances from these cells. He et al. develop a hierarchical textured structure on a 20 Œºm c-Si, combining with a hole transport layer of poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene): poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) to fabri- cate hybrid heterojunction solar cells (HHSCs).[57] The cell man- ufacturing starts by reducing the Si wafer thickness from 270 to 20 Œºm by a concentration of 50 wt. % KOH solutions at 80 C, followed by etching on the side walls to engineer a re- constructed surface as a light-trapping layer. The rear side com- prises a highly doped N+-Si back surface Ô¨Åeld (BSF) layer. In this work, the authors compare textured cells against a Ô¨Çat thin Ô¨Ålm, a conventionally nanoporestructured (conventional-SiNPs), and conventional-SiNPs via a chemical reconstruction process (reconstructed-SiNPs). Figure 6a shows the schematic of the de- signed solar cell with reconstructed-SiNPs. Figure 6b,c show the SEM images of SiNPs after the Ô¨Årst and second rounds of the metal-assisted chemical etching (MaCE) process. After the sec- ond round of etching, compared with the morphology observed in Figure 6b, the feature size of reconstructed SiNPs becomes larger. At the same time, their diameter decreases (Figure 6c). Figure 6d shows the reÔ¨Çection spectra results of 20 Œºm thick Ô¨Ålm c-Si of Ô¨Çat (black line), with textures of conventional-SiNPs (red line), and with textures of reconstructed-SiNPs (blue line). The conventional-SiNPs sample shows a reÔ¨Çection lower than 10% in the 400800 nm visible light wavelength region. At the same time, it reports an increased reÔ¨Çection beyond 800 nm wavelength, reaching similar values of the Ô¨Çat thin Ô¨Ålm (Figure 6d). Compared with the conventional SiNPs sample, the sample of reconstructed SiNPs shows a signiÔ¨Åcant reÔ¨Çectance decrease over the whole wavelength (Figure 6d). Because of the second-order nanostructures on the apex, there is a reduction of reÔ¨Çection in the region of near-ultraviolet wavelength. In con- trast, the enhancement of absorption in the NIR/infrared wave- length region arises from the eÔ¨Äect of impedance-matching, which originates from the bowl-like structure in the texture. Figure 6e shows the averaged reÔ¨Çectance of conventional-SiNPs (red line with circle hollow dots) and reconstructed-SiNPs (black Global Challenges. 2024, 8, 2300306  2024 The Authors.

Figure 6f shows the J V curve of thin Ô¨Ålm Si/PEDOT:PSS HHSCs against a Ô¨Çat thin Ô¨Ålm (black line), a conventional SiNPs (red line), and a reconstructed SiNPs cell (blue line). The sys- tem with reconstructed-SiNPs shows a JSC of 29.1 mA cm2, VOC of 469.2 mV, FF of 67.8%, and PCE of 9.27%. The cell with conventional-SiNPs, conversely, reports a lower JSC of 28.1 mA cm2, indicating that reconstructed-SiNPs provide stronger light-trapping. Figure 6g shows the EQE of thin Ô¨Ålm Si/PEDOT:PSS HHSCs against a Ô¨Çat thin Ô¨Ålm (black line with square hollow dots), conventional-SiNPs (red line with circle hollow dots) and reconstructed-SiNPs (blue line with triangu- lar hollow dots). The EQE of the Si/PEDOT:PSS HHSCs with reconstructed-SiNPs shows superior EQE values over the en- tire wavelength range, resulting from the enhanced absorption in the NIR region with wavelength from 900 to 1100 nm and the wavelength below 400 nm in the short wavelength. In this work, the authors implement a c-Si/PEDOT:PSS HHSCs cell combined with a BSF layer. Figure 6h reports the measurement result of the J V curves about the c-Si/PEDOT:PSS HHSCs. The reconstructed-SiNPs textured 20 Œºm thick c-Si/PEDOT:PSS HHSCs combined with BSF realize a PCE of 13.6%. He et al. explores HHSCs engineered with NC-NPs dual- structured arrays on 20 Œºm c-Si as a light-trapping layer, com- bined with a PEDOT:PSS. The authors implement NC-NPs arrays based on nanosphere colloidal lithography and MaCE techniques.[20] Figure 7a shows the SEM image of a fabricated NC-NPs array. For each NC-NP structure, the height of the NC at the top is 900 nm, while the height of the NP at the bot- tom is 600 nm. The top cone regions possess a polished surface, and the bottom pillar regions are perpendicular to the substrate. Figure 7b shows the surface morphology of a NC characterized by a high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM). The image shows that the surface remains atomically smooth with good-quality Si crystalline structures. Figure 7c illustrates the reÔ¨Çection characteristics of recon- structed NPs arrays fabricated by diÔ¨Äerent MaCE cycles. The c-Si with structures in Figure 7a shows an average reÔ¨Çectance of 1.5% in the wavelength range from 400 to 900 nm (Figure 7c), report- ing one of the most robust anti-reÔ¨Çection properties compared to other methods requiring ten times thicker nanostructures to achieve similar reÔ¨Çection values.[51, 58] The authors perform simulations with Ô¨Ånite-elements solvers to investigate the mechanisms of light-matter interactions be- tween NC and NP. They study the relationship between the op- tical properties of surface texture and the photovoltaic perfor- mance by calculating the optical photo-current losses (JR_loss) from surface reÔ¨Çectance[59]: JR_loss =  ùúÜmax ùúÜmin eùúÜ hc R(ùúÜ)  ùúôAM1.5(ùúÜ) dùúÜ (3) where œïAM1.5(ùúÜ) is the standard sun power density.

Figure 7d shows the schematic of NC-NPs conÔ¨Ågurations. The authors perform simulations between 300 and 800 nm wavelengths and 800 and 1200 nm wavelengths. Figure 7e,f reports the JR_loss calculations of NC-NPs and NPs arrays with diÔ¨Äerent pitch (P) and diÔ¨Äerent Ô¨Ålling ratios (FR). Structures with FR below 0.1 and P between 900 (red line with circle dots and red line with circle hollow dots in Figure 7e) and 1400 nm (blue line with triangular dots and blue line with triangular hollow dots in Figure 7e), together with struc- tures possessing FR below 0.17 and P of 500 nm (black line with square dots and black line with square hollow dots in Figure 7e), show negligible JR_loss diÔ¨Äerences in both the NC-NPs and NPs arrays (Figure 7e), demonstrating their structural insensitivity at low FR. From the results of Figure 7e, we observe that the JR_loss of NC-NP arrays decreases with increasing FR (lines with hollow dots). The JR_loss of NPs arrays, conversely, Ô¨Årst decreases with increasing the FR and then increases slightly with increasing the FR, saturating at a minimum value for diÔ¨Äerent P (lines with dots in Figure 7e). These performances result from the fact that in NC-NPs arrays, there is a graded eÔ¨Äective refractive in- dex transition between the air and the nanostructures, which yields superior anti-reÔ¨Çection behavior. Between the wavelengths of 800 and 1200 nm, the NPs arrays show insensitive proper- ties for light-trapping when FR is higher than 0.1 (lines with dots in Figure 7f). Conversely, the NC-NPs arrays oÔ¨Äer enhanced light-trapping when the FR increases (lines with hollow dots in Figure 7f). The authors attribute this result to the gradient varia- tion of the eÔ¨Äective refractive index between the bulk c-Si and the top surface for the NC-NPs arrays. The authors compute the JR_loss in NC-NPs arrays. They vary the height of NC from 0 to 1500 nm and Ô¨Åx the FR = 0.72, computing their JR_loss in the wavelength windows of 300 800 nm and 800  1200 nm. Figure 7g,h report the results. In the 300 800 nm wave- length range, the JR_loss decreases with increasing normalized NC height (r = h1/h) changing from 0 to 0.5 and saturates to a con- stant value for r up to 1.0. The NC-NPs arrays with P of 500 nm (black line with square hollow dots in Figure 7g) and 900 nm (red line with circle hollow dots in Figure 7g), conversely, exhibit lower JR_loss compared with P = 1400 nm (blue line with triangular hol- low dots in Figure 7g). In the wavelength range of 8001200 nm, when P = 500 nm, the NC-NPs array has the largest JR_loss (black line with square hollow dots in Figure 7h). These results imply that designs strongly impact light absorption when the pitches are comparable to the wavelength of incident light. Figure 7i reports the simulation results of absorption curves for the Lambertian performance of Si Ô¨Ålm with equal thickness (blue line), NC-NPs (red line), NCs (green line), and NPs array (black line) with c-Si substrate of 10 Œºm-thick. The c-Si thin Ô¨Ålm textured with NC-NPs array shows stronger light absorption than c-Si thin Ô¨Ålm textured with NPs and NCs arrays, nearly approach- ing the Lambertian performance between the wavelengths from 300 to 800 nm. Figure 7j shows the normalized electric Ô¨Åeld intensity (|E/E0|) distribution at the wavelength of 400 nm for NP (left), NC (mid- dle), and NC-NP (right) structure. For the c-Si thin Ô¨Ålm textured with NPs array, the strong electrical Ô¨Åeld intensity distributed on the pillar top surface (Figure 7j). It implies that the location of the strong reÔ¨Çectance occurs at the pillars top surface. In contrast, the c-Si thin Ô¨Ålm textured with NC-NPs and NCs array possess strong electrical Ô¨Åeld intensity distributed near the structures tips and corners (Figure 7j). This result shows that the reÔ¨Çectance eÔ¨Äectively suppresses in NC-NPs array and NCs array driven by the morphology of the top surface varying from planar to tapered. The authors further fabricated PEDOT:PSS/Si hybrid solar cells and compared them with a Ô¨Çat c-Si surface, NPs array, and NC-NPs array. Figure 7k shows the J V curves of the PEDOT:PSS/Si HHSCs manufactured on 20 Œºm-thick c-Si sub- strates and with NPs arrays (red line) and NC-NPs (blue line) tex- tures, against Ô¨Çat c-Si with 300 Œºm-thick (black line) as reference. Measurement results show that the hybrid solar cell with NC-NPs array achieves VOC, JSC, FF, and PCE of 0.531 V, 33.7 mA cm2, 68.2%, and 12.2%, respectively. The PCE value from hybrid solar cells with NC-NPs array shows an enhancement of 22% and 72% compared with the hybrid solar cells with Ô¨Çat surface and NPs ar- ray texture. The authors conclude that the best PV performance of hybrid solar cell with NC-NPs array originate from the high JSC based on superior light-trapping property and moderate VOC, which is related to the dense PEDOT:PSS coverage on c-Si and atomically smooth surface. Figure 7l shows the EQE results of the PEDOT:PSS/Si hybrid solar cell with a Ô¨Çat c-Si surface (blue line with triangular hollow point), NPs array (red line with circle hollow point), and NC-NPs array (black line with square hollow point). The PEDOT:PSS/Si hybrid solar cell with NC-NPs arrays has better EQE than PEDOT:PSS/Si hybrid solar cell with NPs array over the entire wavelength range (Figure 7l). 3. Plasmonic Light Management In addition to light-trapping strategies with Si nanostructures, researchers investigate ultrathin Si solar cells with plasmonic textures.[8, 47, 6064] In general, to avoid the suppression of the photocurrent generated from the wavelength below surface plas- mon resonance,[6568] most of the previous works engineered plasmonic structures at the rear side of ultrathin solar cell. Tan et al. developed a plasmonic back reÔ¨Çector (BR) light-trapping strategy by placing silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs)[60] in n-i-p hy- drogenated amorphous Si (a-Si:H) solar cell. Figure 8ac shows the schematic structure of the solar cell with plasmonic BR, Ô¨Çat BR, and textured BR. The plasmonic BR manufacturing in- cludes depositing 12 nm Ag Ô¨Ålm on the Ag/AZO layer after an- nealing at 400 C for one hour in a vacuum oven. Figure 8d,e shows the SEM image and statistic of the Ag NPs size. These AgNPs possess an average equivalent diameter of 205 nm and a surface coverage of 16% (Figure 8d). Almost no small particles with a diameter100 nm are observed (Figure 8e). The fabrica- tion method improves previous manufacturing approaches,[69, 70] which create smaller Ag NPs with a diameter lower than 100 nm and aggregates with relatively large surface coverage more exten- sive than 30%, yielding weak scattering and more parasitic ab- sorption loss. The plasmonic BR provides scattering and diÔ¨Äuse reÔ¨Çection to light not absorbed during a single pass into the solar cell. The angular intensity distribution (AID) and the haze, which is the ratio of diÔ¨Äuse to total reÔ¨Çection, are the two main parameters employed to characterize the light scattering properties of a back reÔ¨Çector.[71, 72] Figure 8f shows the total reÔ¨Çectance R and haze Global Challenges. 2024, 8, 2300306  2024 The Authors.

The haze parameter increases from zero value in a Ô¨Çat BR (Figure 8f) to a high value at short wavelengths in the textured BR, decreasing sharply with increasing wavelength above 600 nm. The plasmonic BR exhibits a haze above 80% in the wavelength range of 5201100 nm (Figure 8f), opening applications either for standard a-Si:H solar cells, which require light-trapping wave- length up to 750 nm, or for lower bandgap absorbers. Figure 8g shows the AID of plasmonic and textured BRs at the wavelength of 600 (orange line with triangular dots), 700 (red line with cir- cle dots), and 800 nm (grey line with square dots). The AID of textured BR and plasmonic BR show a similar trend, decreasing with an increase in the angle. Conversely, plasmonic BR shows superior scattered light intensity than textured BR at each wave- length (Figure 8g). In contrast to textured BR, whose AID decreases with wave- lengths ranging from 600 to 800 nm, the AID of plasmonic BR increases along with varying wavelengths from 600 to 800 nm (Figure 8g). This behavior originates from diÔ¨Äerent scattering mechanisms of textured and plasmonic BRs. While a textured BR relies on surface roughness, a plasmonic BR provides stronger scattering from localized surface plasmon resonances of Ag NPs. Figure 8h shows the EQE results of the p-i-n a-Si:H solar cells with textures (red dashed line) n-i-p a-Si:H solar cells with tex- tures (blue dashed line) and n-i-p a-Si:H solar cells with plas- monic BR (black line). The p-i-n a-Si:H solar cells with textures show higher spectra eÔ¨Éciency at shorter wavelengths than the n-i-p a-Si:H solar cells with textures (Figure 8h). The authors ex- plain this result because of many factors: the absence of i/p in- terface optimizations compared to p-i-n conÔ¨Ågurations, higher absorption losses from the thicker p-layer, and higher surface re- Ô¨Çection of n-i-p solar cells. Figure 8i shows the J V curve of Ô¨Çat (black line), n-i-p a-Si:H solar cells with plasmonic BR (blue dashed line), and n-i-p a-Si:H solar cells with textures (red dashed line) compared to a p-i-n a-Si:H solar cells with textures (magenta dashed line). The work focused on measuring the performances of Jsc at wavelengths larger than 550 nm, because for ùúÜ550 the back reÔ¨Çector scattering eÔ¨Äect is inhibited by plasmonic absorp- tion. The measurements show that the Jsc  550nm of n-i-p a-Si:H solar cells with plasmonic BR is 0.3 mA cm2 lower than the textured p-i-n solar cell (Figure 8i). The PCE of the plasmonic BR-based solar cell is 7.9%. A contribution to the lower perfor- mance outside the BR-based absorption layer also comes from amorphous silicon, which has a higher bandgap than crystalline Si and sustains a lower current eÔ¨Éciency generation. 4. Conclusion This review summarizes current progress and challenges in op- tical mechanisms for photon management in ultrathin Si-based solar cells, including standard Si junctions and polymer-based hybrid heterojunction devices. Light-trapping structures in ul- trathin Si solar cells aim to increase the optical path length through anti-reÔ¨Çection coatings and light-scattering layers. Most designs focus on manufacturing diverse implementations of anti-reÔ¨Çection layers on the top surface of the device, incorpo- rating Ag, Al, or SiO2 as back reÔ¨Çectors. Compared with con- ventionally Si solar cells with ARC of few micron thicknesses, the strategies developed for ultrathin solar cells demonstrated de- signs reaching equivalent visible light absorption in thickness as low as 450 nm. However, present structured surfaces possess the shortcom- ing of a deep junction depth. A deeper junction sustains se- vere Auger and surface charge recombination losses, which ham- pers the Ô¨Ånal device performance. Pioneering work has proposed to address this issue by manufacturing solar cells within a few hundred-nanometer thickness,[5] with a total surface area 67% Global Challenges. 2024, 8, 2300306  2024 The Authors.

Recent work also explored advanced texturing for light-trapping, optimizing simultaneously anti-reÔ¨Çection properties and light-trapping for increased absorp- tion into a single design structure. The increased light path from engineered scattering eÔ¨Äects lowers the device thickness while maintaining suÔ¨Éciently high performances.[24] The present lim- itation of these approaches is their industrial scalability. These de- signs demand elaborate nanostructure patterns that currently re- quire e-beam nanolithography. Future directions in this research area are to scale these designs into cost-eÔ¨Äective light manage- ment textures with the same light absorption properties. From the manufacturing point of view, functional heterojunc- tion in ultrathin Si-polymer hybrid solar cells are particularly attractive as they rely on simple fabrication steps comprising room temperature spin-coating and short-time low-temperature annealing. However, the scalability requires the addition of de- velopment towards slot-die coating or similar techniques. As to these ultrathin Si-polymer hybrid solar cells, because Si acts si- multaneously as a light absorber and carrier generator, it is criti- cal to balance strong absorption eÔ¨Äects with reduced surface area to decrease carrier recombination losses. Ultrathin Si-polymer HHSCs can reach a comparable PCE of 10% of Si-textured ul- trathin solar modules. Despite the various challenges in further optimizing photon harvesting in such small semiconductor volumes, research and development in ultrathin solar cells provide bright opportunities. As of 2019, the industry of Si consumes more than eight bil- lion metric tons of semiconductor material for diÔ¨Äerent appli- cations. Predictions in the coming years forecast that this num- ber will increase steadily and with a 6.5% rise by 2023.[73] With large populations and rapid modernization, such a sharp change increase could strain the global demand-supply balance for the Si manufacturing industry, with substantial repercussions on di- verse markets, including energy, where Si is the most common semiconductor material used in 95% of commercial solar cells available. Photon management platforms that enhance the per- formances of ultrathin cells to a level comparable to commercially available bulk devices will save 1-2 orders of magnitude amount of Si in each Ô¨Ånal module, providing a scalable roadmap to launch economic and performing renewable energy cells for diÔ¨Äerent addressable markets in the next future.
