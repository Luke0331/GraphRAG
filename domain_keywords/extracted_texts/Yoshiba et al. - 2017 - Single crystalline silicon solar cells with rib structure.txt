The open-circuit voltage of a solar cell is known to increase with deceasing wafer thickness if the cell is adequately passivated. However, it is not easy to handle very thin wafers because they are brittle and are subject to warpage. We fabricated a lattice-shaped rib structure on the rear side of a thin Si wafer to improve the wafers strength. A silicon nitride ﬁlm was deposited on the Si wafer surface and patterned to form a mask to fabricate the lattice- shaped rib, and the wafer was then etched using KOH to reduce the thickness of the active area, except for the rib region. Using this structure in a Si heterojunction cell, we demonstrated that a high open-circuit voltage (VOC) could be obtained by thinning the wafer without sacriﬁcing its strength. A wafer with thickness of 30 µm was prepared easily using this structure. We then fabricated Si heterojunction solar cells using these rib wafers, and measured their implied VOC as a function of wafer thickness. The measured values were compared with device simulation results, and we found that the measured VOC agrees well with the simulated results. To optimize the rib and cell design, we also performed device simulations using various wafer thicknesses and rib dimensions.  2017 Author(s).

[http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.4976721] The energy conversion efﬁciency of single crystalline silicon solar cells has improved steadily over the last three decades and recently reached 26%.1 To achieve such high efﬁciency, several tech- nologies, including heterojunctions,2 interdigitated back contacts, and optical conﬁnement structures, have been developed. In addition to these technologies, the wafer thickness remains an important fac- tor for increased efﬁciency. The open-circuit voltage (Voc) is well known to increase with decreasing wafer thickness.3,4 Stanislau et al. reported that the excess carrier density increases in thin solar cells with adequate passivation and optical conﬁnement, and this results in increased VOC.4 In contrast, the short-circuit current density (JSC) decreases for thinner solar cells, but this effect can be minimized using good optical conﬁnement structures. As a result, there is an optimum wafer thickness that leads to high cell conversion efﬁciency; this thickness is considered to be 100 µm or less.4 It is, however, very difﬁcult to handle such thin wafers during the cell fabrication processes, and the production yield can be very low because of wafer breakage. Additionally, large wafer warpage occurs; in fabrication processes such as ﬁlm deposition, screen printing, photolithography, and wafer transfer, warpage is a major cause of reduced production throughput and yield. In power devices such as insulated-gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs), thin silicon wafers with thicknesses of approximately100µmorlessarecommonlyused.Toavoidhandlingdifﬁculties, aspecialribstructure and its fabrication process were developed. This was called the TAIKOTM process by DISCO.5 The fabrication is based on a back grinding process that leaves a rib on the outermost circumference of the wafer and only grinds the inner wafer circumference.

AIP Advances 7, 025104 (2017) handling and warpage are reduced. It is, however, difﬁcult to apply this process to the square wafers that are used for solar cells. Additionally, a large thin area remains inside the rib, and this area is easy to break during the fabrication process. The typical thickness of the thin wafers that are currently used for solar cells is approximately 200 µm. If the wafer thickness is smaller than that value, the frequency with which wafers crack during the fabrication process rises dramatically. To prevent this, it is necessary to attach some type of support substrate to the thin wafer, but this leads to high process costs. In addition, the wafer cost rises with decreasing thickness in very thin wafers such as those at 100 µm or thinner because of their low production yields. As a result, the use of very thin wafers (100 µm) increases the cost of the ﬁnal solar cell. To overcome these difﬁculties, we developed thin silicon solar cells that use a rib structure. We applied a lattice-shaped rib to the back side of the wafer rather than a circle-shaped rib. In power devices, it is necessary to control the wafer thickness and uniformity very precisely, but strict control of these parameters is not required in solar cells. Therefore, we used laser scribing and alkali etching techniques to form the lattice-shaped rib structure used in this work. Subsequently, amorphous silicon layers were deposited on the wafer to form a heterojunction solar cell. In this paper, we describe the process used to fabricate these solar cells with rib structures and present the fundamental photovoltaic characteristics of the devices, including the results of device simulations. A scanning electron microscope (SEM) image (a) and a cross-sectional schematic diagram (b) of the fabricated rib structure are shown in Fig. 1. To fabricate the thin wafers, we provided 4-in n-type silicon wafers with thickness of 280 µm; the typical wafer resistivity was 22.5 Ωcm and the planar orientation was (100). These wafers were ﬁrst dipped in a 5% HF solution that was diluted with water to remove the native oxide. After rinsing with deionized water, silicon nitride ﬁlms were deposited on both surfaces of the wafers by sputtering; the nitride ﬁlm thickness was 100 nm and these ﬁlms were used as etching masks.

Items Description Optical simulation Ray tracing Optical source Spectrum AM1.5 (ASTM-173 Global) Power 100 mW/cm2 Tilt 90 degree Auger recombination Model with temperature & concentration dependent coefﬁcients To form the lattice-shaped rib pattern on the back side of the wafer, we used a laser scriber to scribe the silicon nitride ﬁlm. The laser scriber was equipped with a Nd:YVO4 laser and the laser beams output power and wavelength were 6 W and 532 nm, respectively. The beam was focused on the wafer to scribe the silicon nitride ﬁlm at a line width of approximately 80 µm. The rib was aligned in a direction parallel to the (110) orientation and the rib width (Lrib) was varied from 100 µm to 200 µm. The size of the rectangular segment that was surrounded by the rib structure was 1 mm2 mm. To etch the silicon within this area, we formed a pattern that consisted of multiple parallel lines; the line pitch was 200 µm and the line direction was at 45to the rib, i.e., a (100) orientation. Of course, it is easy to remove the whole silicon nitride layer from this area by laser scribing or photolithographic processes, but when this multi-line pattern was used, a ﬂat etching surface was obtained across this area because of side-etching. Because the rib pattern is formed parallel to the (110) orientation, the side-etching effect is negligibly small because the (111) plane appears; the etching rate of the (111) plane is two orders of magnitude smaller than that of the (100) plane or that of the (110) orientation plane.6 The etching was performed using 30% KOH diluted with water at 80C. The etching rate of the (100) plane was 1.9 µm/min under these conditions. Using this structure, a wafer thickness of 30 µm was easily fabricated. To understand the device properties of these thin solar cells with rib structures, we performed a two-dimensional device simulation using Silvaco software. Use of KOH anisotropic etching meant that the cross-sectional shape of the rib is that of an isosceles trapezoid, where the side legs form 54.7angles with the lower base. In the two-dimensional simulation model, we used a heterojunction structure and deﬁned the device conﬁguration as shown in Fig. 1(b). The major parameters that were used for the simulations are listed in Tables I and II.7 The bulk recombination methods that were taken into account in the simulation were Auger, radiative and Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) recombination. For the indium tin oxide (ITO) transparent conductive layer, a complex refractive index that was provided by the simulator was used for the optical simulations, and in the electrical simulations, the ITO was treated as a conductor with zero resistance. Figure 2 shows the photovoltaic parameters, including VOC, JSC, the ﬁll factor (FF), and the efﬁciency (Eff), as functions of the wafer thickness (Wwafer) for the rib structure and the ﬂat wafers. In this simulation, the pitch (Lpitch) the initial wafer thickness (Winitial) and the rib width (Lrib) were 1200 µm, 280 µm and 100 µm, respectively, and no optical conﬁnement produced by the surface textured structure was applied. Additionally, it was assumed that the surface recombination velocity TABLE II. Principal calculation parameters used in the simulations.

Photovoltaic parameters obtained from two-dimensional simulation using Silvaco software plotted as a function of wafer thickness (Wwafer) for the rib wafer cell and the ﬂat wafer cell. The dimensions of the rib structure were Lpitch=1200 µm and Lrib=100 µm, and it was assumed that the carrier lifetime of the Si wafer is 1 ms and the surface recombination velocity (S) is zero. is zero and the carrier lifetime required to calculate the SRH recombination rate for both electrons and holes is 3 ms in this simulation. When the wafer thickness is 100 µm or more, the photovoltaic parameters of the rib wafer are in good agreement with those of the ﬂat wafer. However, discrepancies in these parameters begin to appear between the two structures. This is because of the effects of the rib region. When the wafer thickness is low, the carrier recombination in the rib region becomes dominant, and as a result, VOC is low when compared with the corresponding value of the ﬂat wafer. With regard to JSC, however, photoabsorption in the rib region is added to that which occurs in the thin wafer region. As a result, the current in the rib structure increases. To suppress the effects of the rib region on the photovoltaic parameters, the volume ratio of the rib region relative to the thin wafer region must be reduced. In Fig. 3, the VOC that was obtained from the simulations is plotted as a function of rib width for several Lpitch values; the thin wafer region thickness was set at 50 µm. The results show that a higher VOC value is obtained when the volume fraction of the rib region is smaller, and it approaches that of the ﬂat wafer structure (0.769 V in this case). Therefore, it is very important to ﬁnd an optimum conﬁguration for the rib wafer from the viewpoints of wafer strength and photovoltaic performance. To study the availability of this thin rib wafer experimentally, we evaluated the implied VOC using the quasi-steady state photoconductance (QSSPC) method. We fabricated a conventional heterojunc- tion cell with an a-Si:H(p)/a-Si:H(i)/c-Si wafer(n)/a-Si:H(i)/a-Si:H(n) structure; the thickness of both the a-Si:H(p) and the a-Si:H(n) layers was 25 nm, while that of the a-Si:H(i) layers was 5 nm. Here, a-Si:H is hydrogenated amorphous silicon, and these layers were deposited using plasma chemical vapor deposition (CVD). The deposition conditions were as shown in Table III. The doping concen- tration of the doped a-Si:H layers was determined from Hall measurements to be 51019 cm 3 for both the p and n type layers. The rib width (Lrib) used in this experiment was 100 µm. 19 June 2025 06:53:03 025104-5 Yoshiba et al. AIP Advances 7, 025104 (2017) FIG. 3.

When the rib region volume is negligibly small when compared with that of the ﬂat thin region, the implied VOC can be obtained using the thickness of the ﬂat region (Wwafer) as the wafer thickness; when it is not negligible, however, the implied VOC cannot be obtained in the usual way. Nevertheless, it can be deduced that the implied VOC of the rib wafer FIG. 4. Comparison of measured implied VOC and simulated VOC in heterojunction Si cell with rib structure for various values of Wwafer. Here, Lrib, Lpitch, and Winitial are 100 µm, 1200 µm, and 280 µm, respectively. 19 June 2025 06:53:03 025104-6 Yoshiba et al. AIP Advances 7, 025104 (2017) has a value somewhere between the values determined from Wwafer and from the averaged thickness when including the rib region. In Fig. 4, the implied VOC values obtained are plotted as a function of Wwafer. The implied VOC values obtained from the two thicknesses are shown at each thickness, and VOC for the rib wafer is expected to lie within the range between these two values. The VOC that was determined from the device simulations for this heterojunction cell with rib structure is shown together with the measured results in the same ﬁgure. The structure and the dimensions used for the simulations were identical to those of the fabricated samples. The surface recombination velocities at the interface between the c-Si and the intrinsic a-Si:H are also required in the simulations. We need three recombination velocities: the front velocity, SFront, the rear velocity, SRear, and the sidewall velocity, SRear(111), and measured these values by the QSSPC method using samples with a-Si:H layer deposited under the same conditions that were used for the rib structure cells; the SFront, SRear, and SRear(111) values were 4 cm/s, 3 cm/s, and 6 cm/s, respectively. As shown in the ﬁgure, the implied VOC values of the rib wafer cells agree well with the VOC value obtained from the simulations. This demonstrates that the rib wafer cell can achieve both high VOC and high wafer strength by reducing the wafer thickness. To enhance the photocurrent of the rib wafer cell, conventional optical conﬁnement based on surface texturization can be used. We have optimized the dimensions of the rib structure and the fabrication process to produce a high-performance rib structured solar cell, and the results for this cell will be published in the near future.
