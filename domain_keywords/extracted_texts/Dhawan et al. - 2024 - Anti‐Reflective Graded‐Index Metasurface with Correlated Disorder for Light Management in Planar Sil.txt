RESEARCH ARTICLE www.advopticalmat.de Anti-ReÔ¨Çective Graded-Index Metasurface with Correlated Disorder for Light Management in Planar Silicon Solar Cells Prerak Dhawan,* Maria Gaudig,* Alexander Sprafke, Peter Piechulla, Ralf B. Wehrspohn, and Carsten Rockstuhl Recently, many research eÔ¨Äorts have been dedicated to improving light coupling into solar cells and reducing optical losses. Promising candidates regarding scalability include direct nano-structuring of the absorber layer, anti-reÔ¨Çective (AR) coatings, or combining both, e.g., pyramidal textures with a conformal coating. However, many of these methods are either insuÔ¨Écient or infeasible for application in thin solar cells. Moreover, approaches based on directly texturing the silicon interface simultaneously strongly increase surface recombination, thus degrading the electronic properties of the solar cell. To circumvent these issues, conformal graded-index metasurfaces with a correlated positional disorder for light trapping in solar cells are proposed and experimentally demonstrated in this contribution. When considered as a part of a prototypical solar cell geometry, a broadband reduction in reÔ¨Çection is observed that results in photocurrent enhancement. The combined consideration of disorder and conformal graded-index layers outperforms structures containing only one of these components. The computational guidance toward optimized designs promises to adjust the framework to other settings. The possibility for large-scale fabrication of the samples paves the way toward a future generation of supporting photonic structures in solar cells. P. Dhawan, C.

DOI: 10.1002/adom.202302964 1. Introduction Highly eÔ¨Écient solar cells are a key com- ponent of our future energy supply, and their development is a prime societal chal- lenge. High eÔ¨Éciency is particularly impor- tant because the available land for the in- stallation of solar cells tends to be a lim- iting factor in the near future. One con- tribution to these developments by the op- tics community has been the development of supporting light management structures that improve light coupling to reduce op- tical reÔ¨Çection losses and light trapping to maximize absorption.[13] Promising candi- dates regarding scalability include directly nanotexturing the absorber, such as the prominent so-called black silicon texture for crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar cells.[4] This texture consists of stochastically ar- ranged nano- to micrometer-sized, tapered Si needles, giving rise to broadband and quasi-omnidirectional strong suppression of back reÔ¨Çection and light trapping close to the 4n2 limit.[4,5] However, nanotextures such as black silicon oftentimes degrade the electronic properties of the solar cell. Degradation occurs be- cause nanostructuring the absorber layer not only introduces ad- ditional defects through the fabrication process but also through the mere strong increase in surface area, thereby increasing the total number of defect sites.[4,6] These defect states increase the surface recombination current, ultimately reducing the output current and, thus, the eÔ¨Éciency of the solar cell. In a nutshell, while black silicon has excellent optical properties, this does not necessarily translate into increased short-circuit current because of predominant electrical losses. Recent research has shown that applying conformal thin Ô¨Ålm coatings to passivate the texture electronically can almost fully recover the electrical degradation introduced by the fabrication process. However, since surface area enlargement is intrinsic to texturing the interface, surface recombination will always be higher compared to an untextured interface.[7,8] Therefore, planar interfaces are much more pre- ferred, and dedicated light management strategies using metallic grating structures,[9,10] photonic crystals,[11,12] nanospheres,[13,14] and many more were perceived to yield enhanced broadband ab- sorption enhancement.[15,16] Metasurfaces with high refractive index nanostructures have demonstrated exceptional broadband antireÔ¨Çection ef- Adv.

Artistic illustration of the light management structure considered here. The disordered GRIN metasurface consists of dielectric discs arranged in a nearly hyperuniform manner deposited on a polished silicon wafer. Then, a conformal graded-index coating above the disks is achieved by conformal deposition of layers with varying fractions of Al2O3 and TiO2. The inset in the Ô¨Ågure compares the reÔ¨Çection from such a device with an unstructured bare GRIN coating, disordered nanodisk array, and a bare Si substrate. fect in silicon solar cells when arranged in a periodic lattice conÔ¨Åguration.[1720] While such periodic arrangements oÔ¨Äer out- standing scattering capabilities by utilizing resonant coupling in the system, the complexity of experimentally realizing periodic structures at industrial length scales remains challenging. This is because periodic metasurfaces often rely on electron-beam lithographic techniques for fabrication. While in perspective, an upscaling is possible using, e.g., nanoimprint techniques, the technology is not yet mature, and there remain technological challenges. Disordered metasurfaces provide a decent trade-oÔ¨Ä when compared to their periodic counterpart and can use a self-assembly approach for realizing large-scale samples.[2124] Recently, an alternative approach was suggested to obtain an all-dielectric graded-index (GRIN) nanostructure integrated on top of an unstructured, i.e., a planar, solar cell.[25] The design in- volves transformation optics and conformally maps a given tex- ture onto an equivalent structure with a planar interface as an ini- tial step. This procedure allows us to derive a dielectric layer with a spatially inhomogeneous refractive index distribution placed on top of the planar absorber layer that leads to similar scatter- ing features as its textured counterpart. However, this mapping is limited to two dimensions since conformal maps in three di- mensions are restricted to inversion, rotation, and translation, which do not capture the desired spatial features needed in the resulting device.[26] Even though not directly applicable, the structures designed with this approach gave inspiration to their 3D implementation. Two features of the novel top layer can be identiÔ¨Åed. First, the properties of the original texture responsible for light scattering translated to a spatial distribution of an inhomogeneous material at some spatial frequencies in the lateral direction. Second, reÔ¨Çec- tion suppression translated into a graded-index material in the normal direction. Combined with the ambition to exploit large- scale fabrication techniques for realization, a promising strategy is to identify a technological route to realize structures with these two features while ensuring that the actual design, and even the optimization, is done in the parameter space accessible in the fabrication process. The state-of-the-art technology we consider here to provide the structuring in the lateral direction is a self-organization process that realizes high-index nanodisks arranged in a nearly hyperuni- form disordered pattern on top of the absorber.[27,28] We realize the desired GRIN proÔ¨Åle by depositing a GRIN thin-Ô¨Ålm coating via atomic layer deposition (ALD) in an ultrathin layer-by-layer fashion and varying the refractive index for each layer on top of the disordered pattern. The Ô¨Ånal disordered GRIN metasurface is illustrated in Figure 1 with the inset Ô¨Ågure showcasing the supe- rior reÔ¨Çectance suppression from one of the fabricated metasur- faces compared to reference structures.

Sim- ilar nanostructures with a dielectric thin-Ô¨Ålm coating have previ- ously been studied in a periodic lattice for their broadband antire- Ô¨Çection eÔ¨Äect in silicon solar cells.[29,30] However, by considering a disordered arrangement of the scatterers and a smoothly vary- ing index distribution, we largely extend the applicability of such intricate structures. In this contribution, samples with diÔ¨Äerent geometrical di- mensions are fabricated, optically characterized, and compared to simulations. We show that our disordered GRIN metasurface can signiÔ¨Åcantly suppress back reÔ¨Çection and improve light trap- ping in a c-Si wafer compared to structures that implement only one of the two design strategies. While considered here to per- ceive a structure that improves the light management in solar cells, other application scenarios will also beneÔ¨Åt from such ma- terials. 2. Sample Fabrication Scheme 2.1. Correlated-Disorder TiO2 Nanodisk Arrays First, disordered TiO2 nanodisk arrays are fabricated on com- mercially available polished 200 Œºm Ô¨Çoatzone silicon wafers (sample area 2  3 cm2) through our previously described self- organized colloid-based nanolithography method.[21,27] This ex- perimental method allows the deterministic variation of the fol- lowing three structural parameters: disk height h, diameter d, and mean center-to-center distance d. Figure 2a,b shows scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of fabricated nanodisk arrays on c-Si wafer with parameters [h, d, d] = [152.5, 235, 461] nm before depositing the GRIN coating. The TiO2 disks homoge- neously cover the entire surface of the sample in a disordered arrangement with strong spatial correlations, classiÔ¨Åed as nearly- hyperuniform.[27] 2.2. Graded-Index Layer Deposition Next, a GRIN coating is applied onto the disordered nanodisk array. For this purpose, we sequentially deposit multiple ultra- thin (5 nm) layers, each with a diÔ¨Äerent composition of TiO2 and Al2O3, by ALD.[31,32] The respective composition determines the refractive index of the respective layer, thus enabling a mul- tilayer coating with refractive index adjustable in steps of 5 nm. The highest and lowest indices are Ô¨Åxed by the materials avail- able to our ALD tool, i.e., TiO2 and Al2O3 with nTiO2 2.4 and nAl2O3 1.7, respectively. This routine allows us to experimen- tally realize transparent GRIN coatings with arbitrary and vir- tually smoothly varying index proÔ¨Åle along its thickness t with nAl2O3 n(t) nTiO2. The index proÔ¨Åle of a fabricated planar GRIN coating (t = 60 nm) comprising 12 layers on top of a Si wafer is plotted in Figure 2e. The experimentally realized linear index proÔ¨Åle, as an- alyzed by spectroscopic ellipsometry, and the target index proÔ¨Åle agree well and illustrate the congruence between the target and the actual index proÔ¨Åle. By changing the ratio of the deposited materials and the thick- ness of individual sub-layers, diÔ¨Äerent polynomial index proÔ¨Åles, e.g., quadratic or cubic, can be achieved. Such polynomial proÔ¨Åles are well explored in literature for broadband AR coatings.[3336] However, for simplicity, we choose to work with a linear pro- Ô¨Åle. Moreover, we suspect that proÔ¨Åles of higher polynomial or- der will only incrementally change the overall broadband optical response of the Ô¨Ånal structure, including the nanodisk array. A thickness of t = 60 nm of the GRIN coating is found to be opti- mal in terms of minimizing broadband reÔ¨Çection of the resulting GRIN metasurface, see discussion below. GRIN coatings such as in Figure 2e are deposited on the TiO2 disordered nanodisk arrays, resulting in our disordered GRIN metasurfaces. Figure 2c,d shows SEM images of the Ô¨Ånal struc- ture after applying a GRIN coating onto the disordered nanodisk arrays shown in Figure 2a,b. In addition to the deposited GRIN Adv.

Theory 3.1. Structural Properties Cylindrically symmetric scatterers are numerically generated by Ô¨Årst obtaining the refractive index distribution of an individual scatterer in the xz-plane by solving Laplaces equation in space. Its solution yields the equipotential lines of constant refractive index. Details are given in the Supporting Information. This en- sures that each layer is conformally stacked over subsequent lay- ers with gradually varying indices along the normal and lateral directions. Such characteristic features in the inhomogeneous re- fractive index resemble typical structures obtained using Trans- formation Optics for wavefront shaping in Ô¨Çat lenses[37,38] and planarized parabolic reÔ¨Çectors,[39,40] and are also essential for light trapping in our proposed structures.[25] The 2D structure is then rotated around the rotation axis of the nanocylinders to achieve a 3D index proÔ¨Åle of the scatterer, see Figure 3a. Such a design strategy is representative of the experimentally obtained structures described above. This is discussed in detail in the Sup- porting Information. To generate a disordered array of scatterers forming the meta- surface (Figure 3b), we quantify their arrangement using the structure factor S(q) given by S(q) = 1 N |||||| N  i eiqri |||||| 2 (1) where ri is the center position of the i-th scatterer among the other N scatterers while q represents reciprocal space vectors. To account for the statistics of disordered scattering interfaces, we generate a suÔ¨Éciently large computation of sample area 30 Œºm  30 Œºm. The disordered arrangement for the sample is ob- tained using a modiÔ¨Åed Random Sequential Adsorption (RSA) process.[27] Figure 3c plots its angular averaged structure factor S(q = |q|) (cyan circles). The numerically generated structure fac- tor is compared with its experimental counterpart (pink squares). We use in-house image-processing for extracting the particle cen- ters from the SEM images (Ô¨Åeld-of-view 80 Œºm  80 Œºm) of fab- ricated samples, and then its structure factor S(q). Based on the good agreement in the structure factors, we Ô¨Ånd that numerically generated disordered arrays statistically correspond well with our experimentally achieved ones. However, since systematic simu- lations of metasurface layer-stacks with cross-sectional areas as large as, e.g., 30 Œºm  30 Œºm or greater, are demanding, we em- ploy a recently published approach that allows us to use much smaller supercells for anti-reÔ¨Çection and light trapping in solar cells.[41] These small supercells are obtained using the collective coordinate method (CCM).[21,41,42] In short, we could show that using even a single CCM-optimized supercell as a standalone simulation object for ensemble averages or a large-scale sam- ple could reliably predict the optical response of large-scale dis- ordered systems with the beneÔ¨Åt of signiÔ¨Åcantly reduced com- putational eÔ¨Äort. The particle distribution shown in Figure 3b uses the structure factor obtained for the large sample (shown in Figure 3c) as a target for realizing CCM samples of cross-section 3 Œºm  3 Œºm. These are later used for an FDTD simulation. To get a Ô¨Ånal material distribution for the disordered GRIN metasurface that can be considered in the simulations, each lattice coordinate is decorated with the previously identiÔ¨Åed refractive index distri- bution for an individual cylinder. More details are given in the Supporting Information. 3.2. Parameter Optimization Height h, diameter d, and mean distance d of the nanodisks, as well as GRIN coating thickness t, are our experimentally accessi- ble degrees of freedom to optimize the light management prop- Adv.

Additionally, the colored lines represent parameter sets P for which broadband reÔ¨Çection is suppressed below JR = 2.5 mA/cm2. erties of the disordered GRIN metasurfaces. We rely on a slightly simpler system to Ô¨Ånd a set of starting values that will serve as the target for fabrication. We choose the periodic case (square lattice with pitch Œõ) to Ô¨Ånd optimal parameters since disordered geome- tries have considerably longer simulation runtimes, which is es- pecially undesirable when considering multidimensional param- eter runs. That periodic structure is called the GRIN metasurface. Furthermore, since our fabricated samples possess nearly hyper- uniform disorder, the scattering response of the periodic case will be representative for the disordered case in the long-wavelength limit due to a vanishing structure factor for small qs.[43] The objective function to be minimized is the reÔ¨Çected pho- tocurrent JR given as, JR(P) = e  1100nm 320nm Œ¶AM1.5G(ùúÜ)Œ¶(P, ùúÜ)dùúÜ (2) where Œ¶AM1.5G is the solar global standard irradiation spectrum, and Œ¶(P, ùúÜ) = R(P, ùúÜ) is the reÔ¨Çection spectrum for a parameter set P = [h, d, t, Œõ]. We perform a hyperparameter optimization to achieve insights on strong performing (low JR) Ps.[44] The re- sults are summarized in Figure 4 in a parallel-coordinates plot. Due to the nature of such an optimization problem, it is essen- tial to distinguish the parameter space when the complete GRIN metasurface is considered from the parameter space when it is not, i.e., we also consider the bare nanodisk array without GRIN coating as well as the planar GRIN coating without nanodisks. This guarantees striving for the optimum in each of these set- tings, a prerequisite for a fair assessment of the beneÔ¨Åts when combining nanodisks and GRIN coating to form a GRIN meta- surface. In Figure 4, we distinguish the diÔ¨Äerent cases by using diÔ¨Äerent line styles, see Ô¨Ågure caption and inset. Moreover, Ps with rather small reÔ¨Çection losses (JR  2.5 mA/cm2) are colored, while all others (JR  2.5 mA/cm2) are (light) gray. The former are chosen for the experimental sample fabrication. Optimized (periodic) GRIN metasurfaces outperform un- coated nanodisk arrays as well as bare planar GRIN coatings, the minimal reÔ¨Çection currents are JR = 1.15 mA/cm2, JR = 1.80 mA/cm2, and JR = 4.26 mA/cm2, respectively. Comparing the tra- jectories of high-performing GRIN metasurfaces (colored solid lines) with high-performing uncoated nanodisk arrays (colored dashed lines), we observe that adding the GRIN coating leads to a lower sensitivity of JR on the remaining parameters, i.e., h, d, and Œõ. Only a narrow range of Ps with t = 0 nm (no GRIN coat- ing) yield JRs comparable to the case achieved with GRIN coating of any given t. This indicates that adding the conformal GRIN coating relaxes the requirements of very Ô¨Åne-tuned nanodisk Ô¨Ålling fractions and heights. Indeed, we can conÔ¨Årm this trend when extending our studies to include disorder, see discussion below. Concerning bare GRIN coatings (dark gray full lines), it is evi- dent that for continuously increasing the thickness beyond the largest value shown here (t = 70 nm), lower JRs may be ob- tained. However, as we observe in the experiment (see below), Adv. Optical Mater. 2024, 12, 2302964 2302964 (5 of 10)  2024 The Authors.

The solid and dashed lines for each subÔ¨Ågure correspond to the experimentally measured and simulated results, respectively. this will not necessarily amount to an increased useful absorbed photocurrent since planar structures cannot couple to any scat- tering/diÔ¨Äraction channels, which is essential for enhanced ab- sorption in the near-infrared spectral range.[45,46] The optimal parameter sets P of GRIN metasurfaces and bare nanodisks are obviously diÔ¨Äerent, in particular, we note that adding the GRIN coating shifts the optimal pitch from Œõ = 0.4 Œºm to Œõ = 0.55 Œºm. However, the Ô¨Ålling fraction, given by FF = ùúã(d + 2t)2/4Œõ2, remains comparable if not strictly equal. This em- phasizes that the superior response of nanodisks combined with GRIN coating cannot be trivially reproduced by nanodisks of the same pitch. 3.3. Optical Response of Disordered GRIN Metasurfaces The insights from the aforementioned parametric optimization are directly fed into the experimental fabrication as target param- eters. Since we fabricate disordered nanodisk arrays instead of pe- riodic ones, the mean nanodisk distance d is given by the pitch Œõ, which will ensure similar scattering features in reciprocal space. Additionally, we perform full-wave simulations of the disor- dered structures. Once obtained, the disordered GRIN metasur- face is then placed on an airc-Si interface for a plane-wave il- lumination from above at normal incidence. ReÔ¨Çectance from that interface and absorption in the c-Si wafer are calculated as the primary quantities. We assume a 200 Œºm thick c-Si wafer and single-pass propagation of transmitted diÔ¨Äraction orders to calcu- late absorption. The absorbed photocurrent Jph and the reÔ¨Çected photocurrent JR for the disordered samples are evaluated using Equation 2 with Œ¶(P) being the absorption or the reÔ¨Çected spec- trum for the given geometric parameters P = [h, d, t, d], respec- tively. Dispersive material properties are taken from experimen- tal measurements and are discussed in the Experimental Section. 4. Results and Discussion In Figure 5, we show the experimental optical response of our best-performing disordered GRIN metasurface, with P = [h = 153, d = 234, t = 60, d = 461] nm, along with numer- ical simulations. Additionally, the response of the disordered nanodisk array, so before applying the GRIN coating, the bare GRIN coating, and the bare c-Si wafer are plotted. As expected, a GRIN coating increases the absorption in the c-Si wafer and eÔ¨Äectively suppresses back reÔ¨Çection, as shown in Figure 5a,b. Almost trivially, this is the case for a planar Si interface (yellow and magenta data) but accounts also for the structured case (cyan and dark blue data) for which the disor- dered GRIN metasurface can not only increase the absorption at short wavelengths, as is the case with bare GRIN coating, but also at longer wavelengths. This holds for the fabricated samples as well as for the numerical results. This can also be seen quan- titatively in Figure 5c,d where the absorbed and reÔ¨Çected pho- tocurrents JR and Jph, respectively, calculated using Equation (2) are decomposed into the contributions from the short and long spectral range. Measured reÔ¨Çectance, absorbance, and the corre- sponding photocurrents contain all the major features predicted by the simulations, indicating the accuracy of our numerical ap- proach. Noticeable deviations from the simulations are only ob- served for ùúÜ 1 Œºm where the measured reÔ¨Çectance increases for all samples due to rear side reÔ¨Çection. This was not accounted for in the simulations. Consequently, this increases the absorp- tion in the wafer beyond the single-pass absorption. Thus, the measured absorption is greater than the simulated. For the wave- length range 0.320.55 Œºm, the individual scattering elements contribute more to the overall response than their arrangement statistics for d = 461 nm, due to the wavelength range being com- parable to the mean interparticle distance. The current densities (absorbed and reÔ¨Çected) of the fabricated samples agree well with the simulations, thus indicating the mean height and diameter of the deposited nanodisks and thickness of the gradient layer coating match well with the simulations. The anti-reÔ¨Çective fea- tures of the graded-index are most intuitive in this spectral re- gion, as the smooth variation in the refractive index decreases the impedance mismatch between air and c-Si. Due to the short absorption depth of silicon (2 Œºm) in this spectral range, en- hanced light incoupling is suÔ¨Écient to increase absorption, as Adv.

For the wavelength range 0.551.1 Œºm, where the presence of correlated disorder inÔ¨Çuences overall scattering, the current den- sities of the fabricated disordered metasurface also correspond well with the simulations, indicating that the particle statistics from the experiments align closely with the simulated data. The superior optical properties of our disordered GRIN meta- surface can be understood when considering not just one such fabricated sample but rather multiple samples with diÔ¨Äerent pa- rameters. Figure 6 summarizes these properties for multiple pa- rameter sets by decomposing the reÔ¨Çected photocurrent of the simulated nanodisk samples into its specular and diÔ¨Äused com- ponents for diÔ¨Äerent spectral regions. For the wavelength range 0.320.55 Œºm, diÔ¨Äused back reÔ¨Çec- tion starts to dominate the overall scattering for increasing inter- particle distance. This is indicated by larger JR, diÔ¨Äuse in compari- son to JR, specular for increasing d from bottom to top in Figure 6a. In this spectral region, the wavelength is comparable to the mean-interparticle distance as well as the height and diameter of the scatterers. The contribution to the diÔ¨Äused back reÔ¨Çection is then due to large individual scatterer response as well as their disordered arrangement (large S(q) for q 2ùúãd, as shown in Figure 3c. While good suppression of reÔ¨Çection for ùúÜ 0.45 Œºm can already occur from having a smoothly varying refractive index along the normal direction, reÔ¨Çection suppression for 0.45 Œºm  ùúÜ 0.55 Œºm depends on having features along the lateral direc- tion, like the dielectric nanodisks in the sample, as they are well- known to preferentially scatter light due to their ability to manip- ulate multipolar Mie resonances in a broadband manner by tun- ing their geometrical parameters.[17,47] These lateral features also have a strong light trapping eÔ¨Äect, as they yield a greater absorp- tion when compared to a bare GRIN coating by exciting higher diÔ¨Äraction orders in the absorbing layer that have a longer op- tical path length. The disordered GRIN metasurface capitalizes on both aspects by having conformally varying index along both normal and lateral directions above the disordered nanodisks. Consequently, the reÔ¨Çectance of the disordered GRIN metasur- face in this spectral region (shown in Figure 6a) is reduced from both specular and diÔ¨Äused components. This reduction extends beyond what is observed in its bare disordered nanodisk counter- part and holds for all the geometric parameters in Figure 6. This observation is consistent with the light trapping eÔ¨Äect obtained from a spatially inhomogeneous material distribution obtained from conformal transformation optics.[25] In contrast, for 0.551.1 Œºm, where the lateral features are not resolved by the incident wavelength, backscattering is lim- ited to only small angles due to S(q 0) = 0 for nearly hyper- uniform particle arrangement, as evident in Figure 3c. In other words, suppressed long-wavelength density Ô¨Çuctuations of the sample allow the system to act as an eÔ¨Äectively homogeneous medium, with ideally no diÔ¨Äused backscattering, thus explain- ing the specular contribution JR, specular overpowering the diÔ¨Äused one JR, diÔ¨Äused.[43] This trend is equally applicable to the disordered GRIN metasurface. Such a response is not expected either from a bare GRIN coating of similar thickness as it will act as a perfect in-coupler at shorter wavelengths but will lose out on this advan- tage in the longer wavelength range due to increased reÔ¨Çection, or from the bare nanodisks as explained earlier. The disordered GRIN metasurface clearly utilizes the advantageous properties of both the disordered nanodisk array and the GRIN coating by act- ing as an eÔ¨Écient anti-reÔ¨Çective structure at short as well as long wavelengths and, at the same time, as an eÔ¨Écient light trapping structure at long wavelengths. To gain a better insight into how the geometric parameters inÔ¨Çuence the overall performance of the disordered GRIN meta- surface, we fabricate multiple such metasurfaces with varying geometrical parameters and compare their optical response with simulations.

Height (50 nm h 210 nm), diameter (130 nm d 370 nm), and mean distance (240 nm d 600 nm) are varied. However, for simplicity, we only show the variation in diameter. This choice of parameters is well-justiÔ¨Åed by the Ô¨Åndings of Figure 4, considering near-optimal reÔ¨Çectance for its periodic counterpart. Each solid marker of a given color in the Ô¨Ågure represents a simulated sample with unique P, while the outlined marker of the same color represents the experimental value extracted from optical measurement. For better readability, we only highlight the samples with red circled markers, while faint colors represent the other samples. We see a reasonable agreement between experimentally measured spectra and sim- ulated spectra for structures with and without the graded-index layer, not only for a single fabricated sample but for a wide range of parameter variations. As prompted by the periodic simulations, the optical response is expected to depend on these geometrical parameters sensitively, and, therefore, it is only ex- pected to become more prominent when considering disordered systems. However, a better agreement is generally seen for struc- tures with the graded-index coating, as the conformally varying index relaxes the constraint of precisely extracting every geomet- rical detail from a fairly large SEM image of the experiment. While the disordered nanodisk array performs comparably to the bare GRIN coating for a few parametric values only, our pro- posed disordered GRIN metasurface consistently outperforms both alternative strategies for all considered parameter combi- nations. This indicates robustness to small geometric variations and was already alluded to in the periodic simulations described above. We Ô¨Ånd the best performing sample for the GRIN meta- surface, as shown in Figure 7 by purple markers (and shown in Figure 5), to increase Jph in the c-Si by 14% and 47% when com- pared to disordered nanodisk array and bare Si substrate, respec- tively. Likewise, JR decreases by 66% and 83% when compared to disordered nanodisk array and bare Si substrate, respectively. Figure 7c,d elaborates on how our proposed structures are nearly immune to minor geometric changes by comparing two diÔ¨Äerent devices with parameters P = [153, 234, 60, 461] nm (shown with purple) and P = [195, 361, 60, 577] nm (shown with olive green) in the top Ô¨Ågure and their respective structures with t = 0 nm in the bottom Ô¨Ågure. While the cumulative current-loss and the photocurrent for the purple and olive devices are com- parable for the disordered GRIN metasurface, the same samples for the disordered nanodisk array have larger diÔ¨Äerences. This diÔ¨Äerence can be seen in the absorption and reÔ¨Çection spectra where the purple and olive samples for disordered nanodisk array clearly possess diÔ¨Äerent scattering features. The olive structure has a pronounced reÔ¨Çection around ùúÜ0.5 Œºm due to the dif- fused contribution as this length-scale is smaller than its mean- interparticle distance and a suppressed specular (and diÔ¨Äused) reÔ¨Çection in the long-wavelength range. In contrast, the purple structure predominantly has specular contribution beyond ùúÜ d = 0.46 ùúám with a pronounced increase at longer wavelengths. For the disordered GRIN metasurface, the olive green and the purple samples possess similar scattering features since both can suppress specular and diÔ¨Äused reÔ¨Çection broadband. Obviously, and similar to the disordered nanodisk array, the only notable discrepancy is due to the shifted peak in the olive green sample, which is attributed to a larger mean interparticle distance for the sample. The periodic optimization can then serve as an informed guess for Ô¨Årst Ô¨Ånding the range wherein most of the disordered GRIN metasurface will possess the superior broadband optical Adv.

Conclusion We suggest equipping a dielectric nanodisk array of strongly cor- related disorder with a GRIN coating for superior broadband re- Ô¨Çection suppression and simultaneous absorption enhancement in c-Si solar cells. The design parametrization for the gradient in- dex was inspired by transformation optics owing to the smooth spatial variations in its resulting refractive index proÔ¨Åle and from the current technological state of the art. The devices are real- ized with cutting-edge techniques for conformal thin-Ô¨Ålm depo- sition and validated using full-wave simulations. Due to the con- formal variation in the refractive index distribution, these struc- tures oÔ¨Äer much lower reÔ¨Çection loss by suppressing specular and diÔ¨Äused scattering throughout the spectral range of interest. Furthermore, adding the GRIN coating relaxes the constraints of Ô¨Åne-tuned geometric parameters of the nanodisks, as all such structures yield considerably high absorption enhancement with the potential of yielding a higher photocurrent upon integration into a standard solar cell stack. Our suggested disordered GRIN metasurface is also promising for thinner solar cells, such as ultrathin c-Si solar cells, for which direct texturing is diÔ¨Écult to accomplish, but antireÔ¨Çection, particularly light trapping, is more crucial. 6. Experimental Section Sample Fabrication: Details of the fabrication process to produce nan- odisk arrays of correlated disorder have been published elsewhere.[27,28] BrieÔ¨Çy, it was based on self-organizing colloidal particle deposition onto a functionalized surface. The particle pattern was then exploited as a mask to etch an underlying TiO2 layer via reactive ion etching (RIE). The process was started by depositing a 14 nm layer of aluminum ox- ide (Al2O3) onto a c-Si wafer via ALD at 120 C, using alternating pulses of trimethylaluminium (TMAl) and water (120 each) in a Beneq TFS-200 thermal ALD tool. Then, a TiO2 layer of 105.5 nm thickness was de- posited via ALD at 120 C using alternating pulses of titanium tetrachlo- ride (TiCl4) and water (1800 pulses each). Furthermore, a 16.8 nm layer of Al2O3 was deposited (120 C, 150 pulses of TMAl and water, each), serving as a functionalization layer for the following particle deposition process. The samples were then exposed to monodisperse aqueous so- lutions of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) particles (microParticles Berlin GmbH, Germany) of varying diameter, which formed an evenly dis- tributed disordered arrangement on the surface.[27] The particles were tempered brieÔ¨Çy (30 min at 135 C) for improved coverage of the sur- face, enabling usage as an etch mask for RIE. The etch process was car- ried out in two steps: First, the top Al2O3 layer was structured into thin nanodisks using a chlorine-containing plasma. In the subsequent Ô¨Çuorine- based process, the structured Al2O3 served as a hard-mask to selectively etch the TiO2 beneath into nanodisks. The bottom Al2O3 layer was only weakly etched in Ô¨Çuorine-plasmas and served as an etch-stop layer. Re- sulting nanodisk arrays are shown, e.g., in Figure 2a,b. The GRIN layer to form the Ô¨Ånal disordered GRIN metasurface consisted of varying ultrathin layers of ALD deposited Al2O3 and TiO2 (see Section 2.2) using the same respective deposition parameters given above. Structural Characterization: SEM images were recorded with a Ô¨Åeld emission microscope (FEI Versa 3D) at 4 kV. Disk diameter and height were evaluated by zoomed-in images of a few particles in the top view and cross-section view, respectively. To extract mean distance d and structure factor S(q), disk positions were extracted from images covering an area of at least 80  70 Œºm2 via template matching, i.e., the image of a sample par- ticle was scanned over the image and tested for similarity at every point. Some disk pairs exhibited nominal surface-to-surface distances 0 nm in- dicating aggregates and were not considered further. Experimental S(q) was then evaluated using Equation (1). Optical Characterization: The refractive indices of the deposited thin Ô¨Ålms were obtained from ellipsometry measurements using a M2000V el- lipsometer and the WVASE software (J.A. Woollam Co). The polarization angle was Ô¨Åxed at 45, and the number of analyzer revolutions to be av- eraged for each measurement point (revs/meas) was 25. Measurements were carried out at incidence/reÔ¨Çection angles from 60 to 85 in 5 incre- ments and in a wavelength range of ùúÜ= 4401000 nm in 1.5 nm increments. To Ô¨Åt the gradient layer, the planar Si sample with the 60 nm linear gradient layer was measured. The Cauchy model (n = An + Bn/ùúÜ2 + Cn/ùúÜ4) was initially selected and subsequently converted into an eÔ¨Äective medium approximation (EMA)-based graded layer. The layer was divided into 12 n-constant sublayers, of which the topmost and the bottom-most layers were Ô¨Åtted. Cn was Ô¨Åxed at zero. The Ô¨Ånal Ô¨Åt yielded An = 2.272  0.014 and Bn = (8.38  0.22)  102 Œºm2 for the bottom layer that corresponded to the values of amorphous TiO2, and An = 1.6543  0.0094 and Bn = (6.10  0.88)  103 Œºm2 for the top layer, corresponding to amorphous Al2O3. Specular and diÔ¨Äuse transmittance, Ts and Td, respectively, as well as reÔ¨Çectance Rs and Rd, respectively, were measured using a PerkinElmer Lambda 950 UV/VIS/NIR spectrophotometer, including an integrating sphere. Experimentally measured absorption amounts to A = 1 Ts  Td Rs Rd. Supporting Information Supporting Information is available from the Wiley Online Library or from the author.
