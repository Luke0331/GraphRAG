REVIEW SUMMARY  SOLAR ENERGY Research opportunities to advance solar energy utilization Nathan S. Lewis* BACKGROUND: Despite providing a rela- tively small percentage of total global energy supply, solar energy systems generally receive enthusiastic support from technologists, reg- ulators, politicians, and environmental groups. The energy in sunlight can be converted into electricity, heat, or fuel. Although the costs of solar panels have declined rapidly, tech- nology gaps still exist for achieving cost- effective scalable deployment combined with storage technologies to provide reliable, dis- patchable energy. ADVANCES: The costs of Si-based solar pan- els have declined so rapidly that panel costs now make up 30% of the costs of a fully installed solar-electricity system. Research and development (R&D) opportunities hence lie in the development of very high efficien- cy conversion materials, to advantageously leverage the associated reduction in area- related balance-of-systems costs. Such mate- rials would optimally either leverage or mate with existing, low-cost Si photovoltaic (PV) technology. Ultralightweight, flexible, robust, and efficient materials could also greatly reduce the installation costs and could allow for enhanced automation and inexpensive support structures. The development of cost-effective persis- tent grid-scale storage to compensate for the intermittency of sunlight is a major area for R&D. Possibilities include new types of bat- teries and flow batteries, as well as geologic storage of hydrogen, methane, or com- pressed air. Opportunities also exist to improve the capabilities of concentrated solar power systems that convert sunlight into heat. Im- proved thermal storage fluids would pro- vide longer-term storage to compensate for cloudy days in areas of high direct insolation. Thermoelectrics, in prin- ciple, could replace en- gines to provide efficient conversion systems that have no moving parts. New thermochemical cycles could allow for the highly efficient, cost-effective conversion of solar heat into fuels by promoting en- dothermic reactions, such as water splitting, carbon dioxide reduction, or thermochemical conversion of feedstocks, such as methane to high energy-density liquid hydrocarbon fuels that are needed in the transportation sector. Artificial photosynthetic systems that di- rectly produce fuel from sunlight are in the proof-of-concept stage. Such technologies of- fer the potential to provide renewable hy- drogen by solar-driven water splitting or to produce hydrocarbons directly from sunlight, water, and CO2. Key goals for R&D are devel- opment of materials that can absorb and con- vert sunlight efficiently that are seamlessly integrated with catalysts that promote the production of fuel, with the production of O2 from water also required to complete a sus- tainable, scalable chemical cycle. Systems must simultaneously be efficient, robust, cost- effective, and safe. OUTLOOK: Considerable opportunities for cost reduction that can achieve both evolu- tionary and revolutionary performance im- provements are present for all types of solar energyconversion technologies. Learning by doing and R&D will both be needed to produce an innovation ecosystem that can sustain the historical rate of cost reductions in PVs and concentrated solar thermal technology. Dis- ruptive approaches to storage technologies are needed to compensate for the intermit- tency of sunlight and allow for develop- ment of a full clean-energy system. Solar fuels technology contains abundant oppor- tunities for discovery of new materials and systems that will allow for deployable, cost- effective routes to the direct production of fuels from sunlight.

Lewis* Major developments, as well as remaining challenges and the associated research opportunities, are evaluated for three technologically distinct approaches to solar energy utilization: solar electricity, solar thermal, and solar fuels technologies. Much progress has been made, but research opportunities are still present for all approaches. Both evolutionary and revolutionary technology development, involving foundational research, applied research, learning by doing, demonstration projects, and deployment at scale will be needed to continue this technology-innovation ecosystem. Most of the approaches still offer the potential to provide much higher efficiencies, much lower costs, improved scalability, and new functionality, relative to the embodiments of solar energy-conversion systems that have been developed to date. B ecause of its unmatched resource poten- tial, solar energy utilization has been the subject of intense research, development, and deployment efforts that have acceler- ated during the past decade (1). Efforts have focused on the development of photovol- taics (PVs) for production of solar electricity, on conversion of solar energy into electricity or heat, and on artificial photosynthetic systems that di- rectly produce fuels from sunlight. The dramatic increases in deployment and concomitant de- creases in the cost of solar energy-conversion systems in the past decade attest to the impor- tance of investments in innovation (1). The cost-effectiveness of terrestrial solar en- ergy systems is dictated by two fundamental constraints. First, as compared with fossil fuels or nuclear fission, the relatively low average ter- restrial power density of sunlight, typically 200 to 250 W/m2, requires very inexpensive materials and systems to cost-effectively cover the large areas needed to capture and convert solar power on a terawatt global scale (2, 3). Second, the in- termittency of sunlight requires cost-effective energy-storage technologies to provide energy on demand with high reliability. This review pro- vides an update on many of the developments that have occurred during the past decade (4) and identifies some of the promising oppor- tunities for further research and development (R&D) in light of the present status and economics of solar energy-conversion technologies.

Downloaded from https://www.science.org at Lanzhou University on June 19, 2025 planar silicon (Si) structure to effect charge separation and to allow for efficient production of photocurrent and photovoltage (Fig. 1) (5, 6). The cost of Si solar panels, measured in dollars per peak watt ($/Wp) has decreased by 20% for each doubling in cumulative global module pro- duction (2, 3). Commercially available Si panels, which accounted for 90% of total solar panel production in 2013, now have an energy payback period of 2.5 years and 16 to 21% power- conversion efficiencies (2, 3). The dramatic re- ductions in panel cost have been realized largely through sustained, systemic reductions in spe- cific manufacturing costs, including those of the polymer encapsulant, the screen-printing of the silver electrical contacts, and even the production of the Si wafers themselves, along with economies of scale enabled by construction of very large panel-production facilities. Research opportuni- ties to further lower costs include methods to integrate higher band-gap materials with Si to create a high-efficiency tandem device in a scala- ble, cost-effective process that is compatible with existing Si PV manufacturing methods. Gallium arsenide and other IIIV single- junction and multijunction PV devices (710) are highly efficient and used on satellites but are currently only considered cost-effective for ter- restrial applications by combining small device areas with high-concentration-factor optics that utilize active solar tracking and optical concen- trating systems. Opportunities exist for obtaining improved efficiencies through spectral-splitting approaches (11, 12), as well as through novel designs for both one-dimensional (1D) and 2D optical con- centration and tracking systems and structures, as wellasindevelopment of new approaches tothe low-cost growth of high-quality, high-performance IIIV monolithic devices and structures. In contrast to active materials based on single- crystal substrates, thin-film materials, such as cadmium telluride (CdTe), CuInGaSe2, amorphous hydrogenated Si, and organic PVs can provide flexible, lightweight modules that could result in reduced system installation costs. Engineered CdS/CdTe heterostructures provide control over junction recombination at the metallurgical inter- face (3). Toxicity concerns related to release of Cd into the environment have been raised, especially in Europe, but have been addressed by rigorous encapsulation of the active material, in conjunc- tion with proposed panel-recycling programs (13). Scarcity issues related to the availability of Te may preclude scaling of CdTe PV technology to terawatt levels (14), but the lower CdTe module efficiencies of 15%, as compared with 16 to 21% efficiencies for Si panels, are presently more important considerations in determining the cost-competitiveness of the various PV panel technologies. Research opportunities involve grain-boundary passivation to allow thin films to exhibit the high mobilities and efficiencies of single crystals. Solar cells based on perovskites formed from lead salts with organic ammonium cations have demonstrated that extraordinary performance can be obtained using simple depo- sition techniques in novel materials systems (7, 1517). The long-term stability of these mate- rials at the highest reported efficiencies remains to be established (17, 18). Intense efforts are cur- rently being devoted to understanding the fun- damental behavior of such systems, as well as to discover other similarly behaving classes of materials that are environmentally benign, do not release toxic lead ions upon dissolution in water, and combine efficiency with stability. Such considerations underscore the complex techno- logical, political, and economic aspects associated with the development a sustainable, cost-effective solar energy-utilization system (1). Earth-abundant light absorbers that could pro- vide alternative materials options for solar ab- sorbers, including Zn3P2 (19, 20), ZnSnN2 (21, 22), and Cu2O (23, 24), are receiving renewed interest after preliminary investigations in the early 1980s (25, 26). Research opportunities involve control over the bulk and surface properties of such ma- terials to obtain high efficiencies, preferably in thin-film form. The performance of organic PV cells, such as thosebasedoncompositesofpoly-phenylenevinylene (PPV)with afunctionalizedC60 thatservesasthe lightabsorber(2730),inprinciple,canbesystemat- ically varied by chemical control over the compo- sition and structure of the components of the device (29). Radical-related side reactions under visible and ultraviolet illumination of the organic materials that form the active components of the device structure must be minimized to obtain long-term stability while preserving high effi- ciency. Research opportunities for dye-sensitized solar cells include the development of molecular sensitizers that exhibit improved photovoltages, as well as enhanced stability, while retaining de- vice efficiency (31, 32). Quantum-confined systems, including inorganic quantumdots, canprovidemultipleelectronsupon absorption of a photon having an energy greater than twice the band gap of the absorber (33). Organic materials exhibit an analogous process denoted as singlet fission (34). Both phenomena could form the basis for solar cells that exhibit ef- ficiencies in excess of the conventional, Shockley- Queisser (S-Q), theoretical limit of 32% for a singleband gap material under unconcentrated sunlight (33). Research opportunities involve in- corporation of this phenomenon into operational devices that exhibit high photovoltages in con- junction with quantum yields in excess of unity for photocurrent production. These materials sys- tems will ultimately have to compete with other approaches to obtain device efficiencies that ex- ceed the S-Q limit, such as multijunction cells, which have already exhibited efficiencies 40% under high concentration (7, 35). Balance of systems The cost of Si solar panels now constitutes 30% of the cost of a fully installed utility-scale system (Fig. 2) (36, 37). The hard materials costs, in- cluding the inverter, support structures, and electrical wiring, make up 30% of the system costs. Soft costs, including installation labor, permitting, inspection and interconnection, fi- nancing, and customer acquisition, make up 40% of the installed system costs. These balance-of- systems costs have not declined nearly as rapidly as module costs. For an installation having a specific peak out- put power, increases in module efficiency would correspondingly reduce the area-related balance- of-systems cost (Fig. 2B). Any viable alternative to Si, or any PV technology that leverages or mates with Si PV technology will ultimately have to ex- hibit long-term stability and superior efficiency at competitive manufactured panel costs. Improve- ments in efficiency, especially through R&D, that result in the development of new materials and PV systems having efficiencies higher than the S-Q limit, would have more of an impact on lower- ing the cost of installed solar electricity than pro- portionate reductions in the manufacturing costs of present Si-based panels, as shown in Fig. 3. To be certified for sale in the marketplace, solar panels are required to contain protective glass that can survive a hailstorm. The cost of the float-glass material is relatively low (38), but the stiffness and weight of the resulting panels pro- duces sizable costs for shipping, requires the use of costly support structures, and produces substantial labor costs for installation. Soft costs are lower in Germany and Australia than in the United States, because permitting and installa- tion processes and protocols have been stream- lined (39, 40). Obtaining much lower installed PV system costs will not only require ultralight- weight, flexible, robust, and efficient materials aad1920-2 22 JANUARY 2016  VOL 351 ISSUE 6271 sciencemag.org SCIENCE Fig. 1. Components of a typical silicon solar cell. The diagram shows the absorber layer, the p-n junction, antireflection coating, grid and contact lines, encapsulation, and glass support structures.

Although the capital costs can be firmly es- tablished for a given PV installation (for example, Figs. 2 and 3), the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) depends on the deployment site, which dictates the electrical energy that is produced by the panels over their useful lifetime and requires assumptions involving the discount rate (i.e., the time value of money), useful system life, and op- erating costs. For utility-scale Si PV systems having fully installed costs of $1.80/Wp, conventional assumptions yield LCOEs of $0.10 to $0.15/kWh, with the lower value for favorable sites, such as in California (41). In 2014, the average U.S. elec- tricity price for large industrial customers, includ- ing generation, transmission, and distribution costs, as well as profit, was $0.07/kWh (42). Grid integration and energy storage Regardless of the competitiveness on a levelized cost basis of solar electricity relative to fossil- based or nuclear-based electricity, the value of electricity produced from an intermittent re- source is not the same as the value of energy that can be provided on demand. In some market scenarios, such as residential installations in areas with high peak electricity pricing, PV cur- rently has a favorable value proposition, especially with tax incentives or other subsidies (41, 43). The full costs of solar electricity must also eventually include costs associated with grid integration, as SCIENCE sciencemag.org 22 JANUARY 2016  VOL 351 ISSUE 6271 aad1920-3 Fig. 3. Costs for installed utility-scale PV projects as a function of module efficiency and module cost. Movement parallel to the abscissa assumes that all costs are held constant other than the module cost (Fig. 2A), whereas movement parallel to the ordinate is based on the assumption that there is a linear proportionality of all area-related costs (Fig. 2B) to the module efficiency. The red dot is repre- sentative as an example of recent utility-scale projects for which citable data are available (38, 39) with 15% efficient Si-based panels at a cost of $90/m2 and with a total installed project fixed capital cost of $2.25/Wp. Utility-scale projects have been chosen because they are less expensive per Wp and less variable than rooftop installations, which have similar Si module costs but had, at the time, fully installed project costs of  $4.90/Wp in California as compared with $2.20/Wp in Germany, with the difference caused primarily by differences in permitting, labor, inspection, and other soft costs.

RESEARCH | REVIEW Downloaded from https://www.science.org at Lanzhou University on June 19, 2025 well as the accompanying cost of energy storage to compensate for daily, weekly, and seasonal variability in insolation (2, 41). To ensure relia- bility, utilities currently back up intermittent re- newables, including solar and wind installations, to nearly their full rated peak capacity with dispatchable generation, generally derived from natural-gas-fired power plants. The cost of per- sistent grid-scale storage currently far exceeds the levelized cost of solar electricity (43, 44). Pumped hydroelectricity is near its technoe- conomic potential globally (44). Compressed-air energy storage will require cost-effective tech- nologies to create robust, full-volume seals in very large underground geological cavities, such as salt caverns (44). Superconducting magnetic- energy storage and flywheels are best suited for high-power, low-energy applications (44, 45). Batteries currently are expensive grid-scale electrical energystorage technologies, especially when the costs are amortized over the 30-year lifetime of an installed solar electricity system (44). If one assumes a 15- to 20-year battery life- time with one cycle per day, conventional or ad- vanced lead-acid batteries have a levelized cost of energy storage (LCES) (not including generation costs) for renewable energy storage and/or time- shifting applications of $0.80 to 1.0/kWh and $0.40 to 0.50/kWh, respectively (46). Under the same assumptions, Na-S batteries, which require operation at 350C to obtain sufficient con- ductivity through the beta-alumina solid electrolyte that separates the liquid sodium negative electrode from the positive electrode composed of a sur- rounding layer of sulfur, have an LCES of $0.30 to $0.40/kWh (46). Capital costs of $250/kWh for the battery cells are part of the $1000/kWh cur- rent cost of a fully installed secondary lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery system for PV storage applications, which results in an LCES of $0.49/kWh, if one assumes a 10-year service life, one cycle per day, a 10% discount rate, a linear capacity decline to 80% of rated capacity atthe end of life, 92% charge- discharge energy-storage efficiency, and no op- erating costs (46, 47). Although the underlying battery chemistry and materials have been rel- atively unchanged for more than 20 years, Li-ion cells are following an 25% learning curve, as cal- culated from sales and production data spanning 2000 to the present (48). Given current average cell costs of $270/kWh, at the historical rate of cost decline, obtaining a $100/kWh Li-ion cell cost would require produc- tion and learning for 25 years, if one assumes a fixed 100 GWh worldwide annual capacity during that time, in accord with expectations for Li-ion battery-production capacity when new, large-production-capacity additions that are cur- rently under construction become operational (48). Chemical reactions between the electro- lyte and solvent in current Li-ion batteries fun- damentally limit the useful lifetime of such batteries (49), regardless of the depth of dis- charge or power-management technology incor- porated into the system. The costs associated with battery-pack integration and management, inverters, and other hardware and labor costs that dominate the total installed system costs are currently much higher than the battery cell costs. Lithium-air (50), lithium sulfur (51), zinc-air (52), solid-state Li (53), and advanced Li-ion battery chemistries (53), among others, are all being explored. Flow batteries, based on electrically charging an anolyte and catholyte and storing the fluids in separate holding tanks until discharge, are a focus of major early-stage R&D efforts (44, 54). Electrochemical couples being developed include aqueous vanadium as V3+/2+, Zn-Br, V-Cr, Fe-Cr, or H2/Br2 systems (54), as well as quinone- hydroquinone redox species (55). Relatively large storage volumes are required because the energy density of flow batteries is typically 20 Wh/liter, compared with an energy density of 200 Wh/ liter for Li-ion batteries and 12,000 Wh/liter for liquid hydrocarbon fuels, such as gasoline. If one assumes a 20-year lifetime and one cycle per day, at typical 65 to 75% charge-discharge effi- ciencies, Fe/Cr and V-based redox flow batteries have an estimated LCES of $0.20 to $0.30 and $0.30 to $0.40/kWh, respectively, with the latter costs resulting from higher materials costs for the V-based system relative to the Fe/Cr or Zn-Br systems (46). Electrically discharging the con- tents of the holding tanks rapidly will require pumping large quantities of liquid into effective contact with highly porous, highsurface area electrodes, which will add to the system cost. Notwithstanding associated carbon emissions, cost-effective generation technology to compen- sate for the intermittency of solar electricity and to provide back-up and firming capabilities for daily and seasonal variability in new solar gen- eration capacity currently uses natural-gas plants (46), with costs expected to remain low where shale gas is abundant. Solar thermal systems The four main types of solar collectors are parabolic trough collectors, linear Fresnel reflec- tors, power towers (i.e., central receiver systems), and dish-engine systems, which produce local temperatures of 550C, 550C, 1000C, and 1200C, respectively (5658). To generate elec- tricity, either an oil or a molten salt heat-storage fluid, typically an eutectic mixture of 60 weight % (wt %) sodium nitrate to 40 wt % potassium nitrate, known as solar salt, is heated. The heat then is exchanged to produce steam, which is used to drive a turbine to generate electricity (Fig. 4) (5). Power conversion units are either separate or combined Rankine-Brayton cycles. As of 2014, the installed global capacity of PV was 177 GWp, as compared with 5 GWp of solar thermal capacity (59, 60). Solar thermal instal- lations are preferably sited in regions with a high direct normal irradiance value, typically in desert regions of the southwestern United States or Australia, or, for example, Morocco or southern Spain (61). Although large-scale solar thermal electricity projects were planned both in the United States and in Morocco, driven by mandates, renewable portfolio standards, and low-carbon electricity incentives, the generation costs have proven to be greater than $0.15/kWh when all installation and operational expenses are included (62, 63). aad1920-4 22 JANUARY 2016  VOL 351 ISSUE 6271 sciencemag.org SCIENCE Fig. 4. Schematic of a typical 1D concentrating solar thermal system. The sunlight is focused along one dimension to heat up a thermal fluidtypically, either an oil or a molten saltwhich is then passed through a heat exchanger to produce steam that is used in a turbine to produce electricity. RESEARCH | REVIEW Downloaded from https://www.science.org at Lanzhou University on June 19, 2025 Between 6 and 8 hours of storage can be ob- tained by use of molten salts as the thermal fluid, but compensation for cloudy days requires 36 hours, or more, of storage. Improved thermal storage fluids are an active area of R&D (64). The all-inclusive costs for solar thermal systems have not declined substantially since the early 1980s (62) (Fig. 5), in contrast to the costs of PV modules and installed PV systems. For example, the Ivanpah Solar Electric Generation system commissioned in 2013 in the Mojave Desert of California is an air-cooled, 392 MW capacity, power- tower system consisting of 300,000 mirrors and three towers. The project had a capital cost of $2.2 billion and is producing electricity under a 25-year power purchase agreement for a price estimated as $0.13/kWh to the cognizant utilities (41). Research efforts include development of power cycles that allow for higher-temperature operation, along with the development of ad- vanced materials for the fabrication of the col- lectors (65), in conjunction with new engineering approaches to the design of the collectors and integration with the rest of the plant (6668). Thermoelectrics could also serve as the technol- ogy that converts heat into electricity, provided that their performance can be improved to the necessary levels under the high temperatures that are produced in an operational solar thermal system (5, 69). Extensive deployment of either PV or solar thermal electricity-generating systems in remote regions with high direct insolation would re- quire installation of new transmission lines. The Sunrise Powerlinka 117-mile-long, 1-GW capac- ity, 500-kV, 90% above-ground transmission line built between 2010 and 2012 to provide solar and wind power from the Imperial Valley to San Diegohad a project cost of $1.9 billion (70). Con- centrated solar power can also be used to provide a source of heat to drive endothermic chemical reactions. In one demonstration system, solar heat is used as a supplement to process heat, to produce synthetic fuel from CO and H2 (syngas) by using the Fischer-Tropsch process (71). For the solar-driven process to be economically viable, the cost of solar-derived heat must be less than the cost of heat derived from combustion of fossil energy, such as natural gas. The capital costs of the solar thermal part of the facilityincluding the costs associated with siting constraints, as well as underutilization of the plant during night time and periods of off-peak insolationmust be covered by the value of the solar-derived heat production. Solar-derived heat can also be used to promote the formation of fuels, such as H2 produced through solar-driven water splitting (72). In an exemplary two-step cycle, CeO2 is first reduced thermally to Ce2O3 with the production of O2, followed by the thermally driven oxidation of Ce2O3 by water to produce CeO2 and H2 (73). Other thermochemical cycles are based on sulfur iodine, hybrid sulfur, photolytic sulfur ammonia, zinc oxide, cadmium oxide, or FeAl2O4 (74). Gen- erally, the cycles exploit temperature swings to evolve O2 and H2 separately, which creates re- search opportunities to explore methods of ob- taining high levels of heat recovery so as to ensure high system efficiencies. Isothermal redox cycles have been proposed to alleviate heat-rejection issues, by use of an open system in which a par- tial pressure change promotes the evolution of O2 by the thermal reaction of CoFe2O4 with Al2O3, and the CoAl2O4 and FeAl2O4 then react with steam to produce H2 and close the chemical cycle (75). Many of these thermochemical water- splitting cycles are also of interest for the produc- tion of H2 from the heat produced by gas-cooled nuclear fission reactors. These thermochemical cycles to date have been demonstrated in process steps at the laboratory or pilot scales. Implementation of these thermo- chemical processes in deployed solar thermal systems will require R&D that enables the needed mass flows of reagents into the reactor while allowing facile product egress from the reactor, in addition to effectively confining the heat in the reactor while allowing for the optical excitation to enter, but not leave, the reactor.

Solar Fuels The direct production of fuels from sunlight could provide a scalable grid storage technology. Liquid fuels are required for ships, aircraft, and heavy-duty trucks, which collectively total 40% of current global transportation fuel demand. Solar fuels technology has thus received recent atten- tion at the proof-of-concept R&D stage in various laboratories worldwide (5). The status of various approaches to solar fuels generation is summa- rized in Table 2. Exquisite chemical synthetic methods have been used to assemble various chlorophyll-based and -related light absorbers in conjunction with precisely connected electron donors and acceptors, to achieve separation of the light-induced electron-hole pairs produced by the chromophore of interest (5, 77, 78). The ex- istence of the natural photosynthetic system implies that it ought to be possible to assemble a fully nonbiological photosynthetic assembly, which provides a goal for research efforts in synthetic organic, inorganic, and materials chem- istry. Particles of inorganic semiconductors, in conjunction with heterogeneous cocatalysts, have been shown to act as artificial photosynthetic systems (5, 79). A research goal is to develop an efficient, stable photocatalytic system that does not produce stoichiometric, flammable mixtures of H2 and O2 (79). In artificial photosynthetic systems based on photoelectrochemical (PEC) cells, (Fig. 6), the charge separation is facilitated by an electric field that is formed at or near a semiconductor- liquid interface (79, 80). Production of fuel gener- ally requires coupling of the separated electrical charges with multielectron catalysts for the half- reactions of interest. In many respects, PEC cells represent the integration of a discrete PV module with an electrolyzer to achieve the conversion of sunlight into H2 and O2 by solar-driven water splitting (79, 81). Regardless of how it is produced, the solar H2 could be used in a turbine or fuel cell for grid storage, and could be used as a transportation fuel either directly as H2, or in- directly by reacting the H2 with CO2 or other carbon-based feedstocks, such as biomass, to pro- duce methanol or other reduced carbon-based fuels (82, 83). Additionally, solar-derived H2 could readily be used as a feedstock to produce am- monia, for use in agriculture, as well as in com- merce and transportation. For a solar-driven PEC-based water-splitting system to be deployed in the marketplace, the PEC system must be advantageous in cost rela- tive to the established, discrete PV + electrolyzer (E) combination that provides the same system- level functionality (79). The levelized cost of H2 (LCH) from a discrete PV+E system has been es- timated to be $7 to $20/kg (84, 85), because of the relatively high cost of electricity from PV in conjunction with a low capacity factor for utili- zation of the electrolysis unit. In contrast, the LCH produced by steam reforming of natural gas is only $2/kg (86). Research opportunities involve the development of a disruptive tech- nology for electrolytic H2 generation, noting that the chlor-alkali electrolysis process has been prac- ticed at scale for more than a century (87). Stor- age in geologic formations has been proposed for renewable hydrogen produced by electrol- ysis (88). In state-of-the-art polymer-electrolyte-membrane (PEM) electrolyzers, the cost of the noble metal catalysts is 6% of the total system costs (89). Even less expensive catalystsbased on Ni-Mo and related alloys on the cathode and mixed Ni (Fe, La, and so on) oxides on the anodeare used in alkaline electrolysis (90), with a facility rated to produce 100 MW of electricity constructed in the 1980s at Aswan Dam (91). Moreover, available electrocatalysts in acidic or alkaline media display much lower overpotentials (92) than available electrocatalystsoperatedatnear-neutralpH(9395). Hence, an integrated photoelectrochemical system must take advantage of substantial cost reductions enabled by integration, other than purely a reduc- tion in catalyst cost, to be advantageous in cost rel- ativetoadiscretePV+Ecombination.Opportunities for such cost reduction are provided by syner- gistic integration of very inexpensive materials in novel form factors and geometries, such as arrays of semiconducting microwires in flexible polymeric membranes (96, 97) coupled to earth- abundant electrocatalysts, with the system able to take up water from the atmosphere as an input feedstock (98). A technology for an integrated solar fuels gen- erator must be robust, efficient, safe, and cost- effective. At present, viable integrated systems can simultaneously meet at most three of these desiderata. Systems that are very efficient and stable are currently made from expensive, com- plex materials assemblies, such as a high-efficiency IIIV PV tandem cell connected electrically in series with, but isolated physically from, an elec- trolysis cell (99). Use of an analogous multi- junction IIIV cell as a photoelectrode in an aqueous electrolyte in either a wired or wireless configuration produces H2 transiently, because integration results in corrosion of the photo- electrode by the electrolyte (100, 101). Electrodes that are cheap and robustsuch as spray-painted coatings of iron oxide as photoelectrodes by themselves or with coatings of electrocatalysts are inefficient (5). Electrolysis or photoelectrol- ysis under bulk near-neutral pH conditions (93, 102104) is inefficient and/or produces po- tentially explosive, stoichiometric mixtures of H2 and O2 over active catalysts for recombination of the products (95, 105108). Photocathodes made from p-type indium phosphide coated with nearly transparent noble metal electrocatalyst films have yielded 13% ideal regenerative cell efficiencies for the pro- duction of H2 from 1 M HCl (aqueous) (109), which illustrates the possibilities for obtaining efficient and stable photoelectrodes for solar fuels production. Operation in acidic or alkaline liquid or polymeric electrolytes is important because intrinsically safe, efficient solar-driven water-splitting systems can be built in these me- dia (81, 110). Some recent examples along this R&D path include the discovery of earth-abundant alternatives to Pt that are stable and highly active for H2 evolution in acidic media (111) and the integration of earth-abundant electrocatalysts into Si microwire arrays for efficient H2 production from acidic media (112). Research opportunities include methods to minimize the obscuring of light associated with typical metal and metal oxide electrocatalysts for fuel-forming half-reactions (113). Porous films allow electrolyte to permeate to the underlying semiconductor and, thus, only par- tially mitigate deleterious corrosion or passivation processes (114). For oxidative processes, amor- phous TiO2 films in conjunction with Ni oxide islands (115), or alternatively the use of reactively sputtered Ni oxide films, have recently been shown to provide extended stability for photoanodes aad1920-6 22 JANUARY 2016  VOL 351 ISSUE 6271 sciencemag.org SCIENCE Table 2.

RESEARCH | REVIEW Downloaded from https://www.science.org at Lanzhou University on June 19, 2025 performing water oxidation in alkaline media (114, 116, 117). These approaches to photoanode protection, which have shown operational stabil- ity and efficiency for water oxidation while op- erating continuously for thousands of hours under simulated sunlight, i.e., passing the charge equiv- alent to 1 year of outdoor operation (114), may allow for new combinations of materials to be utilized. These components will have to be com- bined with other materials and components at scale to realize the full potential of an integrated approach to solar fuels generation. Research op- portunities also lie in the development of a cost- effective balance-of-plant that would provide feedstock water of the requisite purity, as well as facilitate the safe, cost-effective collection of the solar-derived H2 over relatively large areas for distribution and end-use, either as H2 or by conversion to carbon-containing fuels through known thermochemical conversion processes. The multielectron reduction of CO2 to a liquid fuel will require the development of entirely new, unprecedented families of catalysts to effect such a transformation in an energy-efficient and selec- tive fashion. To date, metal electrodes require high overpotentials, are generally unstable at the required reducing potentials, and also produce a wide array of trace organic products (118) that would require an expensive and energy-intensive process step to separate and concentrate the pro- ducts. On specific electrode surfaces, substituted pyridiniums yield partial formation of methanol and other alcohols (119). An engineered bacterial system has been used to produce low concentra- tions of isopropanol from electrolytically gener- ated H2 (120), complementing previous studies that have coupled the enzyme formate dehydrogenase to a semiconductor electrode to demonstrate the direct enzyme-catalyzed photoelectrochemical production of fuel (121). Extensive research ef- forts aim to extend the stability of such enzymes in vitro. Other challenges for CO2 reduction involve the flux limitations associated with utilization of atmospheric CO2 as a sustainable CO2 source, as well as the expense of concentration of CO2 for use as a reagent (122). In conjunction with advances in materials and methods, additional systems-based technoeconomic analysis is re- quired to ascertain whether an artificial system can be constructed, in principle, with much higher efficiency, lower cost, and utility than either natu- ral photosynthesis or direct or indirect solar H2 productionfollowedbythermochemicalconversion of H2 with N2, CO2, or other carbon-containing reactants, such as ethylene or biofuels, to produce value-added, energy-rich fuels and/or chemicals. Promise and potential The remarkable progress that has been made in cost reduction and commercial deployment of solar energy technologies underscores the bene- fits of investment in R&D and indicates the pro- mise of, and necessity for, continued innovation to produce further advances in the field. Both evo- lutionary and revolutionary technology devel- opment, involving foundational research, applied research, learning by doing, demonstration pro- jects, and deployment at scale will be needed to continue this technology-innovation ecosystem. Relative to the embodiments of solar energy conversion systems that have been developed to date, higher efficiencies, lower costs, improved scalability, and new functionality are in principle achievable. Hence, research, engineering and man- ufacturing will need to be pursued in harmony and in a sustained fashion to allow realization of the full potential of solar energy utilization, and to allow the energy in sunlight to make a material, and perhaps dominant, contribution to a sustainable, cost-effective, global energy system.
