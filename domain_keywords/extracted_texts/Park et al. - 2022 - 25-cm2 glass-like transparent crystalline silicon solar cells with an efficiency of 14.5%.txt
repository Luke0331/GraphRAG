However, dry etching, which is used to form a light-trans- mitting structure on c-Si, inevitably causes nanoscale surface damages such as scallops and plasma-induced damage in c-Si. This aggravates carrier recombination, which decreases power conver- sion efﬁciency (PCE) of c-Si TPVs. Here, we propose an effective chemical treatment method for removing nanoscale surface dam- age from c-Si microholes. A large neutral-color c-Si TPV after the chemical treatment exhibits a high PCE of 14.5% at a transmittance of 20%. The chemical treatment also enables systematic control of the hole size (167 nm/s), and, thus, the transmittance is easily tuned from 10% to 70%. The proposed chemical treatment satisﬁes the three development factors of (1) high PCE, (2) opportunity for scale up, and (3) facile light transmittance tuning of c-Si TPVs. INTRODUCTION Transparent photovoltaics (TPVs) are in the spotlight as promising energy conver- sion devices that can expand the applicability of solar cells. This is because they can be applied to various ﬁelds in our daily life such as windows of buildings and ve- hicles where the application of conventional opaque PVs is difﬁcult.1,2 Enabling the partial transmission of incident light in the visible region from 400 to 750 nm, which can be recognized by the human eye, is an essential prerequisite to realize a practical TPV. In this regard, thin-ﬁlm and selective light-transmission technologies have been mainly used to enable partial transmission of the visible light by PVs.38 Among them, selective light-transmission technology is a method that transmits light in the visible region through selective light-transmission regions, while maintaining the conventional PV structure. In addition, selective light-transmission technology allows visible transparency regardless of the thickness of a crystalline silicon (c-Si) wafer, which is known as opaque.8 As a representative example, neutral-color c-Si TPVs reported by Lee et al. employ selective light-transmission technology. Lee et al. placed microhole arrays as light- transmission windows, which are not visible to the naked human eye, on a 200- mm-thick c-Si wafer. The device demonstrated a power conversion efﬁciency (PCE) of 12.2% at a light transmittance of 20% with a cell size of 1 cm2, which is the record PCE among reported neutral-color TPVs.8 However, the device had serious defec- tive sites on the sidewall of c-Si microholes due to the side effect of the deep reactive ion etching (DRIE) method.912 Although the DRIE method is powerful for fabricating structures with high precision and reproducibility, permanent surface damage inev- itably occurs owing to high-energy-plasma-based etching processes on the target 1School of Energy and Chemical Engineering, Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST), Ulsan 44919, Korea 2These authors contributed equally 3Lead contact *Correspondence: kseo@unist.ac.kr https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xcrp.2021.100715 Cell Reports Physical Science 3, 100715, January 19, 2022 ª 2021 The Author(s).

Even though an Al2O3 passivation layer was applied to the surface of c-Si microholes, which is the light-transmission region, it only showed an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of up to 588 mV.8 In addition, the defective area will increase as the device size is increased for practical applications. Therefore, further research is required to over- come the fundamental limitations occurring in the etching process, and a strategy for improving the minority carrier lifetime should be proposed to improve Voc.8 In this study, we propose a simple but powerful chemical wet-etching method using an HF/HNO3/CH3COOH (HNA) solution for removing the DRIE process-induced sur- face damage from c-Si microholes. As the HNA solution has an isotropic etching property for c-Si, the solution can etch in all directions equally regardless of the c- Si crystal orientation. Because of this characteristic, conformal etching is possible on the damaged region of the entire c-Si surface. We conﬁrm that the entire defec- tive sidewall of the c-Si microholes is smoothened through the chemical surface treatment. Moreover, through the chemical surface treatment, it is conﬁrmed that the minority carrier lifetime and implied Voc of the device dramatically improve from 6.56 ms and 549.1 mV (without chemical surface treatment) to 233 ms and 679.2 mV (with chemical surface treatment), respectively. Moreover, the improve- ment in surface quality enables scaling up the device size. As a result, the fabricated large-scale neutral-color TPV exhibits a maximum PCE of 14.5% (transmittance = 20%, cell size = 25 cm2) corresponding to a Voc of 638 mV, short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 28.9 mA/cm2, and ﬁll factor (FF) of 78.8%. Furthermore, the chemical surface treatment enables systematic control of the microhole diameter by a constant etching rate (10 mm/min), while removing the surface damage from the mi- croholes. As the diameter of the c-Si microholes increases from 70 mm (before the treatment) to 190 mm (after the treatment for 12 min), the light transmittance in the visible light region (400800 nm) is systematically adjusted from 10% to 70%. In other words, the proposed method potentially possesses dual advantages of con- trolling the transmittance by changing the c-Si microhole diameter and eliminating the sidewall damage from c-Si microhole arrays. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Improvement in surface quality and passivation properties of transparent c-Si substrates To impart transparency to a c-Si wafer, microhole arrays were employed as light- transmission windows throughout the wafer thickness. First, an Al etching mask was formed by the photolithography process, and, subsequently, c-Si microhole ar- rays were fabricated using the DRIE method (Figure S1). The transmission of all inci- dent visible light was enabled owing to the c-Si microholes, and, thus, a transparent c-Si substrate and a c-Si TPV could be realized.8 However, the DRIE method frequently generates scallops on the microhole sidewall. These scalloped surfaces increase the number of severe defect sites on the c-Si surface.18 Furthermore, ion bombardment in the plasma state by applying a DC bias causes permanent surface damage to a c-Si substrate up to 30 nm.16 Eventually, the surface recombination ve- locity of photo-generated carriers increases because of the above-mentioned sur- face damage to the c-Si substrate (Figure 1A).18 As a result, the surface damage of c-Si signiﬁcantly limits the PCE of c-Si TPVs owing to the loss of photo-generated car- riers due to the carrier recombination. To overcome these limitations, we propose a ll OPEN ACCESS 2 Cell Reports Physical Science 3, 100715, January 19, 2022 Article ll OPEN ACCESS Cell Reports Physical Science 3, 100715, January 19, 2022 3 Article simple but powerful method of removing surface damage from the sidewalls of c-Si microholes via chemical surface treatment using an HNA solution known as isotropic Si etchant. The HNA solution consists of a mixture of hydroﬂuoric acid (HF), nitric acid (HNO3), and acetic acid (CH3COOH). The wet etching of c-Si using an HNA so- lution is common process in the semiconductor industry because of its simple and low-cost nature.1921 Figure 1B shows the etching mechanism of c-Si microhole ar- rays using the HNA solution. The etching mechanism of c-Si microholes can be divided into two steps, namely, Si oxidation and SiO2 removal as outlined in Equa- tions 1 and 2.22 The overall etching mechanism of c-Si using the HNA solution is pre- sented in Equation 3. 3Si + 4HNO3 /3SiO2 + 4NO[ + 2H2O: (Equation 1) 3SiO2 + 18HF / 3H2SiF6 + 6H2O: (Equation 2) 3Si + 4HNO3 + 18HF / 3H2SiF6 + 4NO[ + 8H2O : (Equation 3) The HNA solution is a representative isotropic Si etchant that enables Si etching in all directions regardless of the c-Si crystal orientation. Figures 1C, 1D, and S2 show scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of a c-Si microhole before and after the chemical surface treatment using the HNA solution. As shown in the SEM im- ages, the DRIE-etched c-Si microholes (diameter [D] = 100 mm) contain a severely rough surface (Figures 1C and S2A). In contrast, when the c-Si microhole surface was chemically treated using the HNA solution for 120 s, a clean and smooth surface on the entire sidewall was observed, as damaged c-Si was removed (Figures 1D and S2B). Furthermore, the sidewall morphology of the c-Si microholes was investigated in detail by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM). As shown in the TEM image of Figure 1E, nanosized scallops were observed on the surface of a c- Si microhole fabricated via the DRIE process. Because a transparent c-Si wafer con- tains many microholes as an array, the number of localized nanoscale surface defects of the c-Si microholes signiﬁcantly increase, which indicates that the carrier recom- bination problem may worsen.2325 Furthermore, as shown in the fast Fourier transform (FFT) pattern image in the inset of Figure 1E, the sidewall surface of the c-Si microhole shows multiple crystal planes ({400} and {220}). Nevertheless, the side- wall surface of the c-Si microhole was etched regardless of the crystal plane owing to the isotropic etching property of the HNA solution, so that the smooth surfaces of the sidewall were clearly observed (Figure 1F). In addition, the surface defects of the c-Si microhole can be quantitatively analyzed by estimating the root mean square (RMS) roughness value based on the TEM images. The RMS roughness value of the c-Si microhole sidewall before and after the chemical surface treatment was estimated to be 3.9 and 1.2 nm, respectively, indicating that the RMS roughness value decreased by more than three times through the chemical surface treatment (Figure 1G). Consequently, we conﬁrmed that the damaged surface of the c-Si Figure 1.

For quantitatively determining the change in PV characteristics depending on the surface damage removal of the c-Si microhole arrays, the minority carrier lifetimes of the transparent c-Si substrates before and after the chemical surface treatment were measured using the quasi-steady-state photo-conductance (QSSPC) (Sinton, WCT-120) method (Figure 1H). First, we measured the minority carrier lifetime of the transparent c-Si substrate depending on the chemical surface treatment time. Although the minority carrier lifetime of the transparent c-Si substrate before the chemical surface treatment was 1.92 ms, it rapidly increased with the surface treat- ment time. After 30 s treatment, the minority carrier lifetime was saturated to be approximately 18.0 ms. We conﬁrmed that it increased by 9.4 times, as compared with that of the untreated sample (Figure S3). Additionally, to fabricate high-PCE c-Si TPVs, not only surface treatment but also a surface passivation process should be considered. This is because in addition to removing the damaged c-Si surface, the surface recombination of photo-generated carriers should be minimized by satu- rating the dangling bonds at the c-Si interface. To compare the passivation charac- teristics of the transparent c-Si substrates before and after the chemical surface treatment, 10-nm-thick Al2O3 layers were deposited on the transparent c-Si sub- strates via atomic layer deposition (ALD). As a result, in the case of the transparent c-Si substrate the surface of which was not chemically treated, the change in the car- rier lifetime of the substrate after the passivation with an Al2O3 layer exhibited only a slight increase from 1.92 to 6.56 ms. Although the passivation layer can effectively compensate for the dangling bonds on the c-Si surface, it cannot control the recom- bination process generated by the DRIE process-induced subsurface damage of up to 30 nm deep in c-Si.16 In contrast, in the case of the transparent c-Si substrate after the chemical surface treatment, the minority carrier lifetime of the substrate after depositing an Al2O3 layer showed a signiﬁcant improvement from 18.2 to 233 ms (Figure 1H). In addition, by calculating the carrier recombination velocity based on the measured carrier lifetime, the passivation quality of the transparent c-Si sub- strates before and after the chemical surface treatment was veriﬁed (Equation 4). Seff = W 2   1 teff  1 tin  : (Equation 4) Here, Seff, W, teff, and tin denote the carrier recombination velocity, wafer thickness, mi- nority carrier lifetime, and intrinsic bulk carrier lifetime, respectively. W is 200 mm, and tin is 18,283 ms, referring to the product certiﬁcate of Topsil-produced ﬂoat zone (FZ) n-type c-Si wafers. Consequently, Seff can be obtained using teff measured from the Al2O3- passivated transparent c-Si substrates. The Seff values of the substrates before and after the chemical surface treatment were obtained to be 1,524 and 42.46 cm/s, respectively (Figure 1I). Because a Seff of lower than 50 cm/s is required to achieve high PCE of c-Si solar cells with a surface structure, the decreased Seff value would be a cornerstone for the realization of high-PCE c-Si TPVs.23,25 Additionally, to conﬁrm the potential PV char- acteristics of the transparent c-Si substrates as actual solar cells, the implied Voc under the one sun condition was measured using QSSPC. As a result, when Al2O3 passivation was performed on the substrate the surface of which was not treated, the implied Voc of the substrate increased by about 40 mV from 507.7 mV to 549.1 mV. In contrast, when an Al2O3 layer was coated on the surface-treated transparent c-Si substrate, the implied Voc was increased to 678.2 mV, resulting in a drastic enhancement of about 110 mV, as compared with the substrate without a passivation layer (Figure 1J). The bottom line is that the proposed chemical surface treatment process is important for improving sur- face quality of transparent c-Si wafers to realized high-PCE c-Si TPVs. ll OPEN ACCESS Cell Reports Physical Science 3, 100715, January 19, 2022 5 Article Systematic transmittance tuning of transparent c-Si substrates Another advantage of the chemical surface treatment using the HNA solution is the systematic tuning of the light transmittance by controlling the c-Si microhole diam- eter, while improving the surface quality of the c-Si microhole arrays (Figure 2A). The surface chemical etching was performed by immersing the substrate in the HNA so- lution after fabricating a transparent c-Si substrate with a diameter of 70 mm as an initial substrate. As the chemical etching time was increased, the c-Si microhole diameter increased from 70 to 190 mm after etching for 12 min. The etch rate was determined to be about 10 mm/min (Figure 2B). Figures 2C2F show the top-view SEM images of the c-Si microhole arrays according to the etching time. As the etching time was increased, the microhole diameter increased, while maintaining a uniform circular shape in all directions. To measure the light transmittance of the transparent c-Si substrates fabricated according to the chemical etching time, the total transmittance (specular transmittance + diffuse transmittance) was measured using an ultraviolet-visible-near infrared (UV-Vis-NIR) spectrophotometer. The average light transmittance in the visible wavelength region (400750 nm) was sys- tematically controlled from 10% (without chemical etching) to 70% (with chemical etching for 12 min) depending on the etching time (Figure 2G). In a previous report, to realize the desired light transmittance of a transparent c-Si substrate, different sets of the diameter and spacing of c-Si microhole arrays were designed separately, and relevant photolithography, Al mask formation, and DRIE processes were used for each case.8 In contrast, in the case of the wet-etching method using the HNA so- lution, a substrate with the desired transmittance from low to high can be obtained by adjusting only the wet-etching time (Figure S4). Figure 2H shows a photograph of transparent c-Si substrates with different transmittance values. We successfully fabri- cated transparent c-Si substrates exhibiting various light transmittance values from 10% (without chemical etching) to 70% (12 min etching). Photovoltaic performance of large-size c-Si TPVs Scaling up the device size and increasing the PCE are key problems in practical use of TPVs. In this work, we aimed to realize a high-PCE and large-size c-Si TPV with a size of at least 25 cm2 because we successfully developed a simple and powerful surface treatment method to minimize the number of surface defects. Figure 3A shows a schematic of our c-Si TPV. The fabricated c-Si TPV with a size of 25 cm2 was demon- strated as following the fabrication process (Figure 3B). The c-Si TPV fabrication pro- cess involved the following key steps: (1) transparent c-Si substrate fabrication and subsequent chemical surface treatment using the HNA solution, and (2) PV device fabrication (Figure 3C). First, microhole arrays were formed on an n-type c-Si sub- strate to prepare a transparent c-Si substrate (Figure S1), and, subsequently, surface damage of the c-Si microholes was removed through the chemical surface treatment using the HNA solution. To fabricate a c-Si TPV, a p-n junction was formed on the transparent c-Si substrates by the spin-on-dopant method. Before the formation of the p-n junction, a 2-mm-thick SiO2 layer was selectively formed on the sidewall of the microholes via plasma-enhanced chemical deposition (PECVD) and the subse- quent etching process. The SiO2 layer would act as a diffusion barrier for the p-type dopants to prevent short circuit. After the doping process, a 10-nm-thick Al2O3 layer was deposited through the ALD process to minimize the surface recombination induced by the dangling bonds on the surface of the c-Si microholes. In addition, to minimize the surface light reﬂection, a 70-nm-thick SiNx layer was deposited on the front surface using PECVD. An microgrid electrode with a 200 mm spacing and a 2 mm width was then applied as the front electrode. The microgrid electrode had a uniform square pattern structure, which enabled efﬁcient carrier collection ll OPEN ACCESS 6 Cell Reports Physical Science 3, 100715, January 19, 2022 Article Figure 2.

To evaluate the PV characteristics of the fabricated c-Si TPVs with a size of 25 cm2 (Figure 3B), the current density-voltage (J-V) curve was obtained under AM 1.5G illu- mination (Figure 4A). The PV parameters are summarized in Table 1. In the case of the c-Si TPV the surface of which was not chemically treated, a Voc of 548 mV, a Jsc of 28.0 mA/cm2, an FF of 71.0%, and a PCE of 10.9% were achieved. In contrast, the c-Si TPV with the chemically treated surface exhibited a Voc, 638 mV, a Jsc, 28.9 Figure 3. Fabrication of large c-Si TPVs (A) Schematic representation of a c-Si TPV.

Overall, the sur- face-treated device showed a drastic Voc improvement of 90 mV, as compared with the untreated device. The Voc improvement can be explained through Equation 5.27 Voc = kBT q ln Jsc J0 + 1  : (Equation 5) Here, kB, T, Q, Jsc, and J0 denote Boltzmanns constant, temperature, electron charge, current density, and reverse saturation current density, respectively. As shown in the dark JV curves in Figure 4B, there is a signiﬁcant difference in the Jo value between the chemically treated and untreated devices at a reverse bias of 1 V. The c-Si TPV the surface of which is not chemically treated showed a high leakage current density of 2.26 mA/cm2 at a reverse bias of 1 V under dark condi- tion owing to the inﬂuence of the internal carrier recombination process in the c-Si microholes.28,29 The Jo value was about 60 times higher at a reverse bias of 1 V, as compared with that of the surface-treated c-Si TPV. However, after the chemical surface treatment, the Jo value was close to that of the planar PV. The chemical sur- face treatment effectively reduced the number of carrier recombination sites on the sidewall of the c-Si microholes, thereby reducing the Jo value. Interestingly, as shown in Figure 4A and Table 1, the c-Si TPV the surface of which was chemically treated showed a higher Jsc of 1.1 mA/cm2, as compared with the untreated c-Si TPV. The photocurrent improvement could be explained by the reduced carrier recombination. In other words, the surface-treated c-Si TPV showed lower Jo and higher Jsc than those of the untreated c-Si TPV, resulting in improved Voc. As shown in the external quantum efﬁciency (EQE) spectra of the two devices in Figure 4C, the device the surface of which was chemically treated showed an enhanced EQE value, as compared with that of the untreated device. In addition, the device the surface of which was chemically treated showed an improved integrated Jsc (28.1 mA/cm2), as Figure 4.

We can infer that the chemical surface treatment enhances photocurrent by reducing carrier recombination.28,29 To conﬁrm the reduced carrier recombination, the internal quantum efﬁciency (IQE) was investigated in the entire wavelength region (300 1,100 nm). As shown in Figures 4C and S6, the total transmittance (T) and reﬂectance (R) of the two devices were measured using a UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer, and the absorption (A) value was calculated using the relationship of A (%) = 100-R-T. Af- ter that, the IQE value was derived using the relationship of IQE (%) = (EQE/A) * 100. When comparing the IQE responses of the devices before and after the chemical sur- face treatment, an improved IQE value of the surface-treated device was obtained in the entire wavelength region of 3001,100 nm, although the A values of the two de- vices were almost same. Thus, we concluded again that the photocurrent was improved by mitigating the recombination of photo-generated carriers through the chemical surface treatment. Figure 4D shows the trend of PCE variations accord- ing to the surface treatment depending on the c-Si TPV size. The detailed PV param- eters of the c-Si TPV with a size of 1 cm2 are also summarized in Figure S7 and Table S1. In the case of 1-cm2 c-Si TPVs, a PCE of the surface-treated device was obtained as 13.0% at a transmittance of 20%, indicating a PCE gain of 0.7%, as compared with that of the untreated device. In contrast, in 25-cm2 c-Si TPVs, a PCE of the surface- treated device was obtained as the highest PCE of 14.5%, showing a signiﬁcant PCE gain of 3.7%, as compared with that of the untreated 25 cm2. In particular, the un- treated 25-cm2 c-Si TPV showed a low Voc, resulting in signiﬁcantly lower PCE than that of the untreated 1-cm2 c-Si TPV. This result indicates that the carrier recom- bination would be further accelerated as the size of the c-Si TPV is increased. In contrast, the surface-treated device with a 25-cm2 size showed an improved Voc of 638 mV owing to the outstanding passivation quality. Furthermore, Suns-Voc mea- surement was performed to conﬁrm again the passivation effect attributed to surface treatment (Figure S8). The surface-treated 25-cm2 solar cells have higher efﬁciency than the surface-treated 1-cm2 solar cells because of the greater edge electrode area. In addition to the main grid electrodes, the edge electrode with a width of 500 mm was used on both the front and rear surfaces for photovoltaic performance measurements (Figures S9A and S9B). In general, the interface between the metal-Si contact leads to recombination.30,31 When the cell size is 1 cm2, the ratio of the Si/ Edge electrode contact area is 17.4%, while, on the other hand, the ratio of the Si/ Edge electrode contact area of the 25-cm2 solar cell is 0.8% (Figure S9C). As a result, the 25-cm2 device exhibits a reduced leakage current density by decreasing the number of recombination sites at the interface between the Si and the edge metal area (Figure S9D). Thus, the 25-cm2 transparent solar cells obtained higher Voc values than the 1-cm2 transparent solar cells, ultimately resulting in a higher efﬁ- ciency for the scaled-up device. Finally, even though the device size is 25 times larger than that of the previously developed c-Si TPV,8 a higher efﬁciency by 14.5% was achieved, demonstrating both scaling up and high efﬁciency simulta- neously. Furthermore, as shown in Figure S10 and Table S2, the 25-cm2 transparent c-Si solar cells with various transmittances ranging from 20% to 50% were also Table 1.

The ability to pro- duce transparent solar cells with such a range of transmittances is expected to maxi- mize their applicability. This is the ﬁrst step in practical research that can facilitate the commercialization of c-Si TPVs. In summary, plasma-induced damage and scallops on c-Si microholes generated by DRIE were conformally removed via chemical surface treatment using an HNA solu- tion. The surface-treated transparent c-Si substrates showed a signiﬁcant improve- ment in the minority carrier lifetime and implied Voc from 6.56 ms and 549.1 mV to 233 ms and 679.2 mV after the formation of an Al2O3 passivation layer, respectively. Accordingly, we demonstrated a large c-Si TPV owing to the enhanced surface passivation quality. In addition, the microhole diameter, which is the light-transmis- sion region, increases with the chemical surface treatment time, so that the transmit- tance can be easily adjusted from 10% to 70%. Finally, the c-Si TPV the surface of which was chemically treated showed the highest PCE of 14.5% (Voc: 638 mV, Jsc: 28.9 mA/cm2, and FF: 78.8%) at a transmittance of 20% with a large cell size of 25 cm2. Finally, to improve the efﬁciencies of such transparent c-Si solar cells, we have developed research roadmaps for enhancing their Voc and Jsc values. In terms of Voc, we are attempting to achieve a higher Voc for the transparent device by em- ploying the heterojunction with intrinsic thin-layer (HIT) or tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) structures. These structures will be expected to result in a high Voc of about 700 mV through the introduction of ultimate passivation properties to c-Si. In terms of Jsc, it is expected that Jsc can be improved by employing surface structures capable of effective light trapping on the light absorption area (c-Si area). Based on these two perspectives, we plan further research related to improving the efﬁciencies of transparent c-Si solar cells. We expect that the development of trans- parent c-Si solar cells with an efﬁciency of 18% (transmittance = 20%) will be possible. To sum up, we successfully demonstrated high efﬁciency, scaling up, and even easy transmittance control of the c-Si TPV through the proposed chemical surface treatment. This would be a very remarkable study toward the commercializa- tion of c-Si TPVs.

Fabrication of surface-treated transparent c-Si substrates The transparent c-Si structures were fabricated using double-side polished FZ n-type (100) Si wafers with a thickness of 200 mm and a resistivity of 15 U$cm. Microhole arrays were periodically patterned using an AZ4330E photoresist (AZ Electronic Ma- terials) via the photolithography process. A 400-nm-thick Al layer was deposited on the photoresist pattern as an etching mask. The microhole-array-patterned c-Si sub- strates were etched via the deep reactive ion etching (DRIE, Tegal 200) process with ll OPEN ACCESS Cell Reports Physical Science 3, 100715, January 19, 2022 11 Article a 1,500 W power source, 100 W stage power, and 45 mTorr gas pressure using source gases SF6 (450 sccm) and C4F8 (200 sccm). The DRIE conditions were set to a uniform etching rate of about 3.33 mm/min. Therefore, it takes about 60 min to fabricate the microhole, and this process accounts for 68% of the total process cost. After the DRIE process, the Al metal mask was removed using an Al etchant (type A) for 5 min at 50C, and a cleaning process was also performed using a piranha solution (a mixture of sulfuric acid [H2SO4] and hydrogen peroxide [H2O2]). Chemical surface treatment of the transparent c-Si substrate was performed by immersing the c-Si substrate in an HF/HNO3/CH3COOH (HNA) solution (RSE-100, Transene). Characterization of the transparent c-Si substrate The surface morphology of the transparent c-Si substrate was characterized by ﬁeld- emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, Hitachi S-4800). The sidewall of the microhole roughness was characterized by high-resolution transmission electron mi- croscopy (HR-TEM, JEM-2100F). The minority carrier lifetime and the implied Voc were determined using the quasi-steady-state photoconductance (QSSPC) method with WCT-120 manufactured by Sinton Instruments. The optical transmittance was determined using a UV-visible near-infrared spectrophotometer (Cary 5000, Agilent) equipped with a 110-mm integrating sphere. Fabrication of transparent c-Si photovoltaics After fabricating the surface-treated transparent c-Si substrate, a SiO2 diffusion barrier of 2 mm was deposited on the front side of the substrate by using plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PE-CVD, PEH-600). After the forma- tion of the SiO2 diffusion barrier, a back surface ﬁeld (BSF) layer was formed in a tube furnace under a mixed atmosphere of O2 (125 sccm) and N2 (500 sccm) at 880C by using a phosphorous dopant source (P509, Filmtronics). The phospho- rous silicate glass and SiO2 diffusion barrier after the BSF formation were removed from the front of the substrate using a buffered oxide etchant (BOE). Subsequently, a SiO2 diffusion barrier of 2 mm was redeposited on the rear side of the substrate by using PECVD. After that, an emitter layer was formed on the front surface of the substrate under N2 (500 sccm) at 880C by using a B dopant source (B155, Film- tronics). The SiO2 diffusion barrier on the rear side was removed using a BOE so- lution. An Al2O3 passivation layer with a thickness of 10 nm was deposited on the front side of the wafer using atomic layer deposition (Lucida D100, NCD) and an- nealed under 500 sccm of mixed atmosphere of Ar/H2 (96:4) at 500C. In addition, a 70-nm-thick Si3N4 layer was deposited via PECVD as an antireﬂection coating. A photolithography process was carried out using an AZ9260 photoresist (AZ Elec- tronic Materials) to develop a microgrid electrode as the top electrode. To conclude electrode fabrication, the substrate was dipped in a BOE solution for 3 min, and 600- and 400-nm-thick Al ﬁlms were deposited on both sides of the substrate using thermal evaporation. The active area of the transparent c-Si pho- tovoltaics was 25 cm2. Photovoltaic devices characterization The photovoltaic properties of the transparent c-Si photovoltaics were investigated using a solar simulator (Class AAA, Oriel Sol3A, Newport) under AM 1.5G illumination. The incident ﬂux was measured using a calibrated power meter and double-checked using a NREL-calibrated solar cell (PV Measurements). The trans- parent c-Si solar cells were measured from 1.0 to 1.0 V at a temperature of 25C in air with a voltage scan rate of 380 mV/s. The EQE was measured using a Xe light source and a monochromator in the wavelength range of 3001,100 nm. When measuring the J-V curves and the EQE of the c-Si TPV, the device area was calculated ll OPEN ACCESS 12 Cell Reports Physical Science 3, 100715, January 19, 2022 Article as the total area, including both the light absorption region and the light-transmis- sion area. Optical reﬂectance and transmittance measurements of the transparent c- Si photovoltaics were performed over wavelengths of 3001,100 nm using a UV-Vis/ NIR spectrophotometer (Cary 5000, Agilent) equipped with a 110-mm integrating sphere to account for the total light (diffuse and specular) reﬂected from the samples.
