ARTICLES PUBLISHED: 24 APRIL 2017 | VOLUME: 2 | ARTICLE NUMBER: 17062 Simple processing of back-contacted silicon heterojunction solar cells using selective-area crystalline growth Andrea Tomasi1*, Bertrand Paviet-Salomon2, Quentin Jeangros1,3, Jan Haschke1, Gabriel Christmann2, Loris Barraud2, Antoine Descoeudres2, Johannes Peter Seif1, Sylvain Nicolay2, Matthieu Despeisse2, Stefaan De Wolf1,4 and Christophe Ballif1,2 For crystalline-silicon solar cells, voltages close to the theoretical limit are nowadays readily achievable when using passivating contacts. Conversely, maximal current generation requires the integration of the electron and hole contacts at the back of the solar cell to liberate its front from any shadowing loss. Recently, the world-record eﬃciency for crystalline-silicon single- junction solar cells was achieved by merging these two approaches in a single device; however, the complexity of fabricating this class of devices raises concerns about their commercial potential. Here we show a contacting method that substantially simpliﬁes the architecture and fabrication of back-contacted silicon solar cells. We exploit the surface-dependent growth of silicon thin ﬁlms, deposited by plasma processes, to eliminate the patterning of one of the doped carrier-collecting layers. Then, using only one alignment step for electrode deﬁnition, we fabricate a proof-of-concept 9-cm2 tunnel-interdigitated back- contact solar cell with a certiﬁed conversion eﬃciency 22.5%. I n recent decades, the market of photovoltaics has been consis- tently growing and the yearly installed photovoltaic capacity has increased from 328 MWpeak in 2001 to 50 GWpeak in 2015. This resulted in 2016 in a cumulative capacity of 235 GWpeak (ref. 1), largely based on crystalline-silicon (c-Si) solar-cell technologies2, and contributing to about 1.3% of the global electricity production3. To further increase this number, the cost-competitiveness of photo- voltaics must surpass that of classic, non-renewable energy sources, and one route towards this goal is to raise the conversion eﬃciency of industrial c-Si solar cells4,5. High power conversion eﬃciencies require maximizing the solar-cell electrical parameters: open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill- factor (FF) and short-circuit current density (Jsc). For the Voc and FF, this is possible by using passivating contacts, employing silicon oxide or hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) thin films to minimize charge carrier recombination at the electrical contacts to the c-Si wafer, with demonstrated record eﬃciencies for two-side- contacted solar cells of 25.1% (refs 6,7). Maximum Jsc values can be achieved using a back-contacted architecture, eliminating front metal electrode shadowing and minimizing optical reflection and absorption losses at the front. Small-sized back-contacted solar cells, based on diﬀused silicon homo-junctions, were realized at several research institutes (refs 811), showing a best conversion eﬃciency up to 24.4% (ref. 12). Industrially, the back-contacted architecture was pioneered by Sunpower, recently reporting on large-area devices with very high Jsc values and eﬃciencies surpassing 25% (ref. 13). Considering these achievements, integrating passivating contacts in a back-contacted architecture is the obvious c-Si single-junction solar-cell design towards highest conversion eﬃciencies. Such an approach has increasingly been researched in both academia and industry over the past decade1421, resulting in the past few years in several record devices with eﬃciencies 25% (refs 2226). Technologically, it is of note that all these outstanding results have been reached with passivating contacts that are either silicon-oxide-based22 or fabricated by low-temperature depositions of hydrogenated silicon thin films2426, distinctive of the so-called silicon heterojunction (SHJ) technology (ref. 27). Most recently in 2016, with an interdigitated back-contacted SHJ (IBC-SHJ) device, Kaneka Corporation achieved an impressive conversion eﬃciency of 26.6% (ref. 28), which is now approaching the theoretical limit for single-junction solar cells based on c-Si of 29.4% (ref. 29). Whereas the high-eﬃciency potential of back-contacted devices based on the SHJ technology has been clearly shown, their fabrica- tion with industry-relevant methods and low-complexity processing is still largely unresolved. The sole disclosed fabrication process of a top-eﬃciency (25%) IBC-SHJ solar cell reveals the need for several wet-chemical etching or cleaning processes, as well as alignment and photolithographic patterning steps25, making it unsuitable for low- cost, high-throughput manufacturing of solar cells. In this article, we demonstrate a radically simplified self-aligned, bottom-up approach to interdigitated back-contact formation that exploits the surface dependency of silicon thin-film growth obtained by plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD). The local crystallinity of the deposited hydrogenated silicon (Si:H) material mimics that of the underlying film and, in this way, we can form a doped bilayer oﬀering tailored heterogeneous conductivity properties. This enables an interdigitated back-contacted (IBC) device concept with drastically simplified alignment requirements and fabrication. This solar cell is hereafter referred to as tunnel- IBC, because it relies on interband-tunnelling electric transport30 1École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), Institute of Microengineering (IMT), Photovoltaics and Thin Film Electronics Laboratory, Rue de la Maladière 71b, CH-2000 Neuchâtel, Switzerland. 2Centre Suisse dÉlectronique et de Microtechnique (CSEM), PV-Center, Rue Jaquet-Droz 1, CH-2002 Neuchâtel, Switzerland. 3University of Basel, Department of Physics, Klingelbergstrasse 82, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland. 4King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), KAUST Solar Center (KSC), Thuwal 23955-6900, Saudi Arabia. *e-mail: andrea.tomasi@epﬂ.ch NATURE ENERGY 2, 17062 (2017) | DOI: 10.1038/nenergy.2017.62 | www.nature.com/natureenergy 1  2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

For simplicity, the front stack is represented as a bilayer of a-Si:H(i) and SiNx, similarly as for the tunnel-IBC. We note that at the front alternative passivating ﬁlms or a double ARC can also be used. transversely across the deposited doped layers. Our best tunnel- IBC solar cell, realized with a single alignment step and no photolithographic patterning, has a conversion eﬃciency 22.5%, which improves slightly after light-soaking31. The tunnel-IBC solar cell Figure 1 shows the cross-sectional schematic of the tunnel-IBC solar cell, along with its low-complexity fabrication process. For comparison, the architecture of a conventional IBC-SHJ solar cell, as used by refs 2426, is also shown in Fig. 1f. The distinctive element of the tunnel-IBC is the boron-doped p-type hydrogenated silicon thin film which is deposited at the back side as a blanket layer, without patterning, and leads to the formation of an interband silicon tunnel junction. Although similar approaches to IBC-SHJ simplification have been proposed32,33, their experimental feasibility remained unproven. Our tunnel-IBC solar cells use bifacially textured n-type c-Si [c-Si(n)] wafers, with front and back surfaces that are passivated by intrinsic hydrogenated amorphous silicon [a-Si:H(i)] interlayers of only a few nanometres in thickness. At the front side, the thin a-Si:H(i) passivating film is then covered by a low-temperature (200 C) silicon nitride (SiNx) anti- reflection coating (ARC), providing excellent surface passivation, high transparency, and good light in-coupling. With this approach, front-side eﬀective recombination velocities below 3 cm s1 are obtainable, which is vital to achieve eﬃcient minority-carrier collection in back-contacted devices34,35. At the back side, we used an in situ shadow mask during the PECVD deposition to pattern the phosphorous-doped n-type hyd- rogenated silicon [Si:H(n)] thin film, as shown in ref. 36. Following mask removal, a boron-doped p-type hydrogenated silicon [Si:H(p)] thin film is then deposited covering the entire back surface. In this way, without patterning, the hole collector is formed in those areas devoid of Si:H(n) where the Si:H(p) film is in direct contact with the a-Si:H(i) layer. Elsewhere, we have the electron collector consisting of an a-Si:H(i)/Si:H(n)/Si:H(p) triple layer stack, which features an interband silicon tunnel junction (TJ) at the Si:H(n)/Si:H(p) interface. Notably, TJs are already successfully used in a variety of monolithic multi-junction solar cells3742, and in our application we capitalize on this prior knowledge. The specific thin-film material requirements to achieve eﬃcient interband-tunnelling passivating contacts for electrons are discussed in detail in the following section. Key to this approach is the fact that the doped Si:H carrier collectors for electrons and holes are self-aligned with respect to each other. Thus, to finish the device, it is suﬃcient to subsequently align the interdigitated back electrodes to the pattern of the Si:H(n) thin film (which has the shape of a comb in our device). These electrodes were fabricated by depositing a transparent conductive oxide (TCO) film and a thicker metal overlayer, similar to the contacts used in two-side-contacted SHJ technology. These materials were then patterned with a simple and scalable process based on inkjet printing of an etch resist and wet-chemical etching as described elsewhere36. The total number of process steps to fabricate our device is remarkably low, ten when counting c-Si wafer texturing; front and back a-Si:H(i) passivation; front ARC, back Si:H(n) and Si:H(p) depositions; TCO/metal deposition; inkjet printing; wet-chemical etching; and etch resist removal. In addition to its low-complexity fabrication, our approach also tackles other critical limitations of back-contacted SHJ solar cells. First, for both interdigitated electrodes, the TCO film contacts exclusively the p-type Si:H thin-film material, which limits contact 2  2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

Thus, the TCO film does not need to have diﬀerent material properties in each contact, which would increase the complexity of the process. Second, in the tunnel- IBC design the deposited Si:H(p) layer has a uniform thickness. This eliminates the problem of insuﬃcient charge-collecting film thickness along the perimeter of the contacts43,44 that is associated with the tapered doped layer profiles produced by in situ shadow- mask patterning45,46. Requirements for eﬃcient tunnel-IBC solar cells In eﬃcient tunnel-IBC solar cells, the interband-tunnelling passivating contact for electrons (see close-up schematic in Fig. 2a) must collect and transport electrons from the c-Si absorber to the back electrode, without resistive losses. Hence, the first requirement is to integrate a low-resistance TJ at the interface of the p- and n-type Si:H thin films. A second requirement is that our interband-tunnelling contact must have good selectivity toward electrons, which also implies high passivation of the underlying c-Si surface. In passivating-contact technologies, carrier selectivity is usually supported by an elec- tric potential at the c-Si surface, induced by the carrier-collecting material47,48. For a stack of suﬃciently thin layers, the resulting c-Si surface potential can be aﬀected by the presence of overlying films that are not directly in contact with the c-Si surface. Even the upper- most film in thin three-layer stacks, such as the TCO film in SHJ contacts, may influence the underlying c-Si surface potential49,50. Consequently, to guarantee high electron selectivity, the Si:H(n) layer of the interband-tunnelling contact must be engineered to induce, but also to shield the c-Si surface potential from the presence of the Si:H(p) overlayer. A final requirement for the thin-film materials used in the tunnel-IBC is dictated by its specific contacting scheme, as shown in Fig. 1e. A low lateral conductance of the Si:H(p) thin film outside the interband-tunnelling contact area is mandatory to prevent the electrical connection of the two contact polarities from short- circuiting the device. To meet the requirement of forming a low-resistance TJ, highly doped n- and p-type Si:H thin-film materials are needed. Current transport mainly occurs by internal field-emission in interband TJs (ref. 30), and high doping on both sides of the interface guarantees extremely narrow potential energy barrier widths (see also Fig. 2b), yielding an extremely low contact resistivity. Meanwhile, highly doped Si:H(n) films also help screen the c-Si surface potential from the Si:H(p) overlayer51, thus preserving good electron selectivity for the interband-tunnelling contact. Highly crystalline silicon thin films can accommodate a larger number of electrically active dopant atoms, compared to purely amorphous ones, as also evidenced by their higher conductivity (see for instance52 and Supplementary Table 1). For this, we explored deposition conditions similar to those fostering nanocrystalline silicon thin-film growth5355 and silicon epitaxy56, hence character- ized by a considerably lower silane concentration in the deposition plasma than conventional doped a-Si:H layers. Recall that nanocrys- talline Si:H thin films typically present a nucleation region where the material is still amorphous, the so-called protocrystalline growth regime57, which has a thickness that may vary up to several tens of nanometres, depending on the deposition parameters58. In this protocrystalline growth regime, the phase of the growing material also depends critically on the substrate surface chemistry and crys- tallinity58. This substrate selectivity, earlier identified as of prime im- portance in the technological application of nanocrystalline silicon thin films59, enables the tunnel-IBC approach. Doped Si:H thin-film materials deposited at low silane concen- tration were used to fabricate interband-tunnelling contacts. The quality of electric transport across such contacts, including the TJ, was evaluated by performing contact resistance measurements.

The x-axis indicates the position along the interband-tunnelling contact stack shown in a. Highly doped p- and n-type materials correspond to a narrow depletion region across the TJ, facilitating holeelectron recombination processes. specific contact resistivity values for the best TJ materials were measured in the range of 510 m cm2 (see Supplementary Note 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1). Note that these values are equal to or lower than those of a variety of state-of-the-art electron passivating contacts, without any embedded TJ55,6065. Hence, the requirement of a low-resistance TJ is satisfied using these materials. Additionally, we fabricated two-side-contacted test solar cells to evaluate full-area interband-tunnelling electron contacts at the back of an otherwise conventional two-side-contacted SHJ solar cell (see Supplementary Fig. 2). The electrical parameters of these cells are revealing for carrier selectivity and surface passivation properties of the back contact. They showed that the interband-tunnelling contact formed with our doped Si:H films also satisfies the requirement of good electron selectivity. Satisfying the requirement of low lateral conductance of the Si:H(p) film, contrasts with the requirement of having high material doping and conductivity in the TJ area for eﬃcient transverse carrier transport. We overcame this problem by integrating a sophisticated doped Si:H bilayer into the tunnel-IBC device. The microstructure of the doped Si:H thin ﬁlms We produced the tunnel-IBC solar cell using a patterned comb of Si:H(n), defined by shadow masking during deposition, as a seed to induce growth of a highly crystalline Si:H(p) material selectively in the area of the TJ. This allowed us to locally achieve a material with high transversal conductivity. The microstructure of a-Si:H(i)/Si:H(p)/TCO and a-Si:H(i)/Si:H(n)/Si:H(p)/TCO layer stacks deposited onto mirror-polished (111) oriented c-Si wafers was assessed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). In both types of stacks we find amorphous/crystalline mixed-phase materials. Dark-field scanning TEM (DF STEM) micrographs and inverse Fourier transforms of high-resolution high-angular annular dark-field STEM (HAADF STEM) images highlight the characteristic conical shape of Si crystallites in an amorphous Si matrix58, with crystals becoming larger along their growth direction (see Fig. 3b,c,e). A crystallographic analysis by high-resolution HAADF STEM imaging reveals that the Si:H(p) microstructure diﬀers when deposited on a-Si:H(i) (as for the hole contact) compared to when deposited on Si:H(n) (as for the interband-tunnelling contact). Indeed, large grains are observed to span across the Si:H(n)/Si:H(p) interface in Fig. 3c, hence indicating that the Si:H(n) layer acts as a nucleation layer for the overlaying Si:H(p), with epitaxy also observed locally across this interface (highlighted by the arrowhead NATURE ENERGY 2, 17062 (2017) | DOI: 10.1038/nenergy.2017.62 | www.nature.com/natureenergy  2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

Alternatively, Si:H(p) grown directly on a-Si:H(i) exhibits characteristic conical shaped crystals that originate from nucleation seeds (see Fig. 3e). Not all of the crystallites appear to grow directly at the interface with the Si:H(i) layer, and a thin (5 nm) a-Si:H nucleation layer is observed in most regions. This guarantees a suﬃciently low lateral conductance in the Si:H(p) layer and hence a good electrical insulation between the two contact polarities in the tunnel-IBC design. Employing Si:H(p) layers with higher crystallinity and conductivity was found to reduce the shunt resistance, and hence to result in lower cell performances, especially at low illumination intensities. Conversely, fully amorphous p-type films did not form eﬃcient TJsand were found to detrimentally aﬀect the series resistance and the FF of tunnel-IBC solar cells. In Supplementary Note 2, the inadequacy of fully amorphous p-type and n-type films in forming eﬃcient TJ is discussed and demonstrated by means of experiments with two- side-contacted SHJ test solar cells (Supplementary Table 2). The diﬀerence in growth of amorphous/crystalline mixed-phase silicon materials on c-Si versus a-Si:H substrates was earlier discussed according to the cone kinetics model66,67. For the specific substrate, the silicon film morphology can be predicted by a specific deposition phase diagram based on growth and nucleation rates of the competing phases67. Hence the diﬀerence observed in the growth of the Si:H(p) layer on top of the a-Si:H(i) film, when compared to Si:H(n), is expected. When growing on Si:H(n), Si:H(p) grows locally on top of crystalline surfaces, where the deposition phase diagram diﬀers from the case of a-Si:H surfaces, resulting in epitaxial growth in some regions. In conclusion, we argue that the inhomogeneous surface conditions at the back, resulting from the alternating a-Si:H(i) and Si:H(n) surfaces, were used to shape in a bottom-up approach two diﬀerent Si:H(p) thin-film materials, deposited under the same plasma conditions: one formed an eﬃcient TJ and the other formed an eﬃcient hole passivating contact. This was achieved maintaining a suﬃciently low lateral conductance that prevented detrimental short circuits and was facilitated by the protocrystalline growth regime, which is critically surface dependent. Figure 3a shows a cross-sectional schematic of the resulting doped Si:H bilayer. By this, we resolved the puzzle posed by the conflicting requirements (low- resistance TJ and low lateral conductance of the Si:H(p) film) and made the patterning of the p-type layer superfluous. High-eﬃciency proof-of-concept tunnel-IBC solar cells Using the Si:H(p) and Si:H(n) thin-film materials examined above, we fabricated tunnel-IBC solar cells with conversion eﬃciency (η) consistently higher than 22% (see Supplementary Tables 3 and 5). The highest certified eﬃciency amounts to 22.6%, with a Voc of 728 mV, for a solar cell featuring a designated area of 9 cm2. Figure 4a shows its 1-sun current densityvoltage (JV) characteristic along with the extracted electrical parameters independently confirmed at Fraunhofer ISE CalLab PV Cells testing laboratory (as shown in the Supplementary Note 5). Each device was measured in dark and high reverse-voltage bias up to 30 V with no evidence of breakdown. The shunt-resistance values extracted from these curves were all 5 k cm2, higher than in classical dopant-diﬀused homojunction c-Si solar cells68. After being measured at Fraunhofer ISE, the certified solar cell of Fig. 4a underwent light-soaking for 30 h at 1-sun irradiance. After light-soaking, following the procedure described in Methods, we measured in-house the electrical parameters, and the JV characteristic, reported in Fig. 4b. Light-soaking improved the conversion eﬃciency by about 0.3% absolute, in agreement with the recent findings of Kobayashi and colleagues31. With this measurement, we demonstrated a maximum conversion eﬃciency of 22.9% for the tunnel-IBC solar cell. The conversion eﬃciency level of these demonstrator devices was achieved by using a more transparent front-side stack16 compared to our earlier back-contacted devices36, enhancing the Jsc of the cell. Also, widening the TCO/metal fingers of the hole contact to exploit the homogeneously thick Si:H(p) layer improved carrier collection35. These adjustments in combination with the designed material properties of the doped Si:H bilayer all contributed to the improved eﬃciency. Next steps to achieve higher eﬃciencies can be based on using thinner c-Si wafers to increase the open-circuit voltage of the solar cell, combined with improved light-management schemes to increase its short-circuit density. At the front, the replacement of the a-Si:H(i) film with a highly transparent dielectric passivating layer can decrease parasitic absorption of short-wavelength photons. Alternatively, the use of a sub-nm a-Si:H film capped by SiNx (ref. 69) looks also an interesting and simple option. At the rear, the integration of advanced reflectors into our contacts can improve the red response of the cell70.

A more detailed analysis of the eﬃciency losses aﬀecting this best tunnel-IBC, compared to the record device fabricated by Kaneka Corporation26 using the conventional IBC-SHJ architecture, is reported in Supplementary Note 4 and Supplementary Table 4. We underline that our device concept may also be suitable for other materials used in passivating contacts, such as transition metal oxide or alkali earth metal and alkali metal fluoride materials6062,72. We recall an earlier work where a TiOx thin film, interposed between p- and n-type a-Si:H films connecting two sub-cells of a tandem thin-film device, was found to be beneficial for the performance of the solar cell73. This would extend the scope of this work and make the tunnel-IBC the approach of choice for designing the architecture of back-contacted devices with passivating contacts. Conclusions In this work we demonstrated a low-temperature interdigitated back-contacted c-Si solar cell with passivating contacts and high eﬃciency, where patterning and alignment complexity are significantly minimized: the tunnel-IBC. Key to the success of this solar cell is a special bilayer of doped hydrogenated silicon thin films, with a functionalized microstruc- ture: highly crystalline or partly amorphous, where high doping or low lateral conductance is respectively needed. We achieved these unique properties by selecting a protocrystalline growth regime, where the microstructure of the growing material is defined by the substrate surface. This special film is used to simultaneously form an eﬀective interband-tunnelling passivating contact for electrons and a hole passivating contact that are electrically well insulated from each other. Proof-of-concept devices with high conversion eﬃciency over 22.5% have been achieved with excellent Voc of about 730 mV and Jsc always surpassing 40.5 mA cm2. These results are among the best reported for solar cells with SHJ contacts based on traditional IBC schemes18,2426,28. The combination of back-contacted and passivating contact technologies defines the ultimate c-Si single-junction solar-cell architecture. However, its practical implementation has remained challenging, especially with respect to industrially viable processes. The tunnel-IBC concept contributes to solve this problem, delineating a realistic approach with little fabrication complexity and an entire new class of back-contacted solar cells. Methods Solar-cell fabrication and characterization. Tunnel-IBC devices were fabricated on n-type, 250-µm-thick 4-inch float-zone (100) oriented c-Si wafers with a nominal resistivity of 3  cm. The device has an active area of 9 cm2, excluding the bus bar region, and was placed at the centre of the wafer. Wafers were textured in a potassium hydroxide solution, forming pyramids of 5 to 10 µm in size featuring (111) c-Si oriented facets, and cleaned by a wet-chemical process. Following a short dip in a diluted hydrofluoric solution, a thin a-Si:H(i) film of about 6 nm was deposited on both entire wafer surfaces as a passivating layer. Doped Si:H materials, deposited at higher hydrogen-to-silane gas-flow ratios, were used as a hole-collecting layer as well as to form the interband-tunnelling passivating contact for electrons. Intrinsic a-Si:H and doped Si:H layers were grown at temperatures 200 C by means of PECVD in Octopus II and Octopus I reactors from INDEOtec SA, respectively. The front-side SiNx ARC was deposited by PECVD at a low temperature (200 C). A full-area TCO/metal stack consisting of a sputtered TCO and Ag was used to fabricate the back contact. Patterning of the interdigitated back electrodes was achieved by hot-melt inkjet printing of an etch resist with the commercial system PiXDRO LP50 of Meyer Burger B. V. (Netherlands) and subsequent wet-chemical etching in an acidic solution36. After wet-chemical etching, the inkjet-printed etch resist was removed using a liquid solvent. Before solar-cell characterization, a curing process at approximately 200 C in a belt furnace was carried out to repair a-Si:H(i) and doped Si:H layers from potentially present sputter-induced damage74. The light JV characteristic of the solar cell shown in Fig. 4a was measured at the Fraunhofer ISE CalLab PV Cells testing laboratory. This certified solar cell was used to calibrate a second tunnel-IBC solar cell that we used as reference for the in-house JV measurements shown in Fig. 4b and in Supplementary Tables 3 and 5. These in-house measurements were performed under standard test conditions (AM 1.5G spectrum, 100 mW cm2, 25 C), with a Wacom WXS-90S-L2 solar simulator and without applying spectral mismatch correction. A black-anodized aluminium mask was used while measuring to define the solar-cell designated area. Shunt-resistance values were extracted from the slope of a linear fit to the dark JV characteristic in the range (0,100) mV. Material characterization. For TEM observations, a-Si:H(i)/Si:H(p)/TCO and a-Si:H(i)/Si:H(n)/Si:H(p)/TCO layer stacks were deposited onto mirror-polished (111) oriented c-Si wafers . Such surface orientation was chosen as pyramidally textured (100) oriented c-Si wafers used for tunnel-IBC device fabrication feature (111) oriented facets. Thin cross-sections were prepared using the conventional focused ion-beam lift-out method in a Zeiss NVision 40 using a final milling voltage of 2 kV to reduce Ga-induced surface damage. STEM DF images were recorded in an FEI Tecnai Osiris microscope, while high-resolution HAADF micrographs were obtained in an image and probe Cs corrected FEI Titan Themis microscope. Both systems were operated at 200 kV with a beam current of about 100 pA. For HAADF imaging, the beam convergence semi-angle was set to 28 mrad and the camera length to 115 mm (corresponding to an HAADF detector collection semi-angle of 55.5 to 200 mrad). Inverse Fourier transforms of high-resolution HAADF images were computed using an in-house-written Mathematica script, with a mask diameter of 0.8 nm1 centred on selected reflections. Contrast, brightness and gamma values of inverse Fourier transform images were adjusted to highlight the crystallites of interest. Additional TEM experiments, performed using the FEI Titan Themis microscope, are discussed in Supplementary Note 3, and include high-resolution TEM imaging and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy mapping. EDX maps were recorded with a beam current of 200 pA and a solid angle 0.7 srad, using four-quadrant silicon drift detectors (see Supplementary Fig. 3). Data availability.
