This is extremely impressive high production volume by any measure. About 90% of this production is done using crystalline Si wafers. Despite the competition from the other materials and technologies, strong growth in the crystalline Si cell technology and improvement in efﬁciency has led to strong position of this technology in current market. There is further scope for improvement in technology which will lead to cost reduction. International technology roadmap on crystalline Si cell technology has identiﬁed several areas of improvements in crystalline Si cell like front metal contact, front and back surface passivation, bulk material, reduction in wafer thickness, and alternative anti-reﬂection techniques. It is anticipated that the future crystalline Si solar cells will be much thinner than the current standard of 180 microns. In this scenario efﬁcient light harvesting becomes key to growth of the technology and cost reduction. Anti-reﬂection and light trapping techniques will play a key role in efﬁcient light trapping by future solar cells. In this context, this book brings an insight into various aspects related to reﬂection, refraction, and light trappings in c-Si cell technologies. Basic physics and technology for light trapping in c-Si-based solar cell has been covered starting from traditional light trapping structure to advanced light trapping structures based on nanostructures.

Different types of solar cell technologies have been discussed in brief and the importance of c-Si based solar cell technology has been debated. Also the importance of light trapping technology in solar cells has been discussed. 1.1 Place of Solar PV Technology in World Energy Mix Energy is primary requirement for any kind of living creature. Since the beginning of civilization, we are using energy resources for different types of needs whether it is for food cooking, lighting our houses, running our vehicles, and many other activities. Different sources for energy are used like biomass, oil, gas, etc., to fulﬁll our needs of energy. Together with social and economic advancement of civiliza- tion, consumption of energy has also increased. Many energy resources of different kinds are explored over the years which include nuclear energy, geothermal energy, solar thermal energy, etc. Though there are many sources for energy, primary source is mostly Sun. The sources of energy that we use, e.g., biomass, oil, gas, nuclear energy, etc., are the result of energy conversion from one form to other via different natural processes. In other words, Sun is the ultimate source of energy. The two parameters that are driving the energy consumption across the globe are due to growth of population and growth of economic activities. The worldwide population is increasing day by day. In 1800, the world population was estimated around 1 billion and by 2011, it became 7 billion (see Fig. 1.1a). The twentieth century has seen most drastic increment in human population and hence the increment in energy consumption. In 2012, the global primary energy need was estimated around 12000 million ton oil equivalent (Mtoe) which is equivalent to about 140000 terawatt hour (TWh). It is expected that this primary need would further increase, and the primary energy requirement would be about 16800 Mtoe, i.e., about 196000 TWh by 2030.

Singh, Anti-reﬂection and Light Trapping in c-Si Solar Cells, Green Energy and Technology, DOI 10.1007/978-981-10-4771-8_1 1 Electricity is one of the most convenient form of energy and has become integral part of our lives. The consumption of electricity indicates the development status of a country and supposedly more developed countries use more electricity. In 2013, the estimated worldwide electricity production was around 23391 TWh (International Energy Agency 2015). Fossil fuels contributed major proportion in electricity pro- duction, which was about 67.2% (Coal: 41.1%, Oil: 4.4%, and Natural gas: 21.7%). The next major contributor was hydroelectricity with the contribution of 16.6%, followed by nuclear electricity with contribution of 10.6%. Biofuels and waste contributed about 2% in total energy production. A complete contribution for electricity production in the form of pie chart can be seen in Fig. 1.1b. It can be seen that electricity based on fossil fuel dominates electricity production. By now it is globally clear that there are downside of using electricity produced from fossil fuels. Fossil fuels are available in ﬁnite quantity and their excessive use leads to emission of greenhouse gases causing environmental damage. Greenhouse effect is referred to the trapping of some of the energy from the Sun in Earths atmosphere. When the solar energy is radiated back from the Earths surface to space, it is absorbed by atmospheric gases such as water vapor (H2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), ﬂuorinated gases, etc., and re-emitted in all directions. Out of these gases, CO2 is a major threat. The concentration of CO2 in earth atmosphere is increasing due to excessive use of fossil fuels. In 1965, the CO2 concentration in earth atmosphere was less than 300 parts per million (ppm) which has increased to about 400 ppm by 2015. Increased CO2 concentration is having serious impact on climate change, mainly resulting in global warming. In the last 100 years, the average temperature of the Earths surface has increased by about 0.85 C (BBC News 2016). The major increment in temperature/global warming has happened in the last three decades which is about 0.6 C, an alarming number. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) (http://www.ipcc.ch) forecasted that earth surface temperature change may exceed 1.5 C by the end of the twenty-ﬁrst century relative to 1850. A 2 C change is generally threshold and Fig. 1.1 a World population over the years; b contribution of different resources in electricity production in year 2013 2 1 Solar Cells Overview and Perspective to Light-Trapping Schemes regarded as dangerous warming as it would impact the earth climate heavily and may result in natural disasters. All the countries in the world are trying to make policies to tackle the global warming effect and devising policies to mitigate it. Renewable energy sources are being given due importance and being encour- aged as an alternative to fossil fuels. Renewable sources that are being considered include hydro plant, wind, solar thermal, solar photovoltaics, biomass, tidal energy, wave energy, ocean thermal energy, etc. These renewable energy resources are technically having unlimited availability. Out of various renewable sources, cur- rently biomass and hydro are major contributors in energy production. Due to huge energy demands and different process/conditions required for extracting energy from different renewable sources and limitation imposed by the nature of renewable energy source, all the energy needs cannot be met by exploring a single source and there is requirement of energy mix from different renewable resources. Solar photovoltaic (solar PV) or solar cells-based energy generation have important role in exploring renewable energy technology in cleaner and greener way. Though solar photovoltaic/solar cell technology presently contributes less than 0.1% in energy production, it has huge potential. Having based on nonmoving semiconductors for electricity generation, the solar PV technology offers several beneﬁts which include environment friendliness, noise-free operation, minimal maintenance requirements, and long working life. One of the core strength of the solar PV technology is its ability to provide modular electricity solutions as per the need of consumers. The technology can provide solution for very low power requirements like in Watt and at the same time it can also provide solution to high-power requirements in megawatts. The initial cost of solar cell-based elec- tricity generation is holding point for its mass scale use and continuous efforts are being put to make it cheaper and affordable. International energy agency (IEA) predicts that 11% of total worldwide elec- tricity need would be supplied from solar cell-based technology by 2050 (Tanaka 2010), and it would result in reduction of 2.3 gigatons CO2 emissions. The annual PV power generation in 2010 was 37 TWh and it is expected that by 2030 it would become 1247 TWh and would touch 4600 TWh mark by 2050. Similarly, the cumulative installed PV-based electricity generation capacity reached 178 GW by the end of 2014 from 27 GW in 2010 and is expected to rise to 872 GW by 2030 and 3155 GW by 2050. This will lead to an obvious increase in annual global PV market from 7 GW/year in 2010 to 105 GW/year by 2030 and expected to touch the 150 GW/year mark by 2050. 1.2 Historical Development of Solar Cells When a solar cell is subjected to light or electromagnetic radiation, it generates electricity. This effect is known as photovoltaic effect. The beginning of solar cell history starts from discovery of photovoltaic effect in 1839 by Bequerel. He 1.1 Place of Solar PV Technology in World Energy Mix 3 observed the photovoltaic effect, i.e., generation of electricity under the inﬂuence of light by illuminating silver bromide (AgBr) and silver chloride (AgCl) coated Pt electrodes submerged into AgBr and AgCl acidic solution respectively (see Fig. 1.2a) (Green 2002a). After Bequerels experiment in 1839, Adam and Day, while investigating photoconductive effect in selenium (Se) in 1876, observed that when Platinum (Pt) comes into contact with Se bar (see Fig. 1.2b), it result in current ﬂow under the inﬂuence of light. This observation led to the development of ﬁrst thin ﬁlm Se-based solar cell by Fritt in 1883 (Green 2002a). Until 1940, the Se-based thin ﬁlm solar cell-like structure as shown in Fig. 1.2c remained the most efﬁcient solar cell where copper dioxide (CuO2) or thallium sulﬁde (Tl2S) or Se used as active absorbing material with suitable metal contacts. These early year solar cells were based on Schottky contacts in which semitransparent metal layer were deposited on top of active absorbing layer and metalsemiconductor contact resulted in asym- metric electronic junction. In 1941, the ﬁrst p/n junction solar cell came into existence at Bell Labs by Russel Ohl where he showed photovoltaic effect in grown-in junction which was formed by impurity segregation in slowly recrys- tallized silicon melts (Treble 1998). Most of the solar cells produced today are based on p/n junction. In 1954, Chapin, Fuller, and Pearson reported the ﬁrst diffused p-n junction-based c-Si solar cell with efﬁciency of 4.5%. Since then there has been revolution in photovoltaic research and development and different types of solar cells along with c-Si solar cell technology were developed over the years, e.g., III-V (GaAs, InP) based solar cells and II-VI (CdS, CdTe), I-III-VI semiconductor Fig. 1.2 a Schematic of Bequerel experimental setup; b Adams and Day experimental setup for photovoltaic effect study in Selenium (Se); c Most efﬁcient solar cell structure developed till 1930s (after Ref. Green 2002a) 4 1 Solar Cells Overview and Perspective to Light-Trapping Schemes (CuInGaSe) based thin ﬁlm cells. Most of the cells were single junction cell, however, the band gap tunability in III-V based semiconductors also led to multi-junction solar cells development which resulted in reduced optical and electrical losses and efﬁciencies higher than single junction solar cells. 1.3 Different Solar Cell Technologies Fundamental objective of research in solar cell technology is to drive the cost down and increase the efﬁciency up, both of these measures would be helpful in reducing the per unit cost of electricity generated. It is challenging to keep the cost of the solar cell fabrication low and at the same time expect for best efﬁciency. In this endeavor, scientists all around the world have been researching several material possibilities in order to ﬁnd the best compromise between optical and electrical performance of the cell material and its cost of production. Typically, more efﬁcient cell means more complex design and hence more cost. The research and development in solar cell technology were aimed by considering either the cost aspect as ﬁrst priority or the efﬁciency aspect depending upon the application. For terrestrial applications, cost aspect is more important and the efﬁciency is secondary if it is to be made affordable to masses. However, there are applications where efﬁciency aspect matter much more than cost aspect, e.g., space applications. In the last 7080 years, there have been many types of cell development and the cell types are generally identiﬁed with the active absorbing material used. The solar cells can categorize into three different categories as shown in Fig. 1.3. First cat- egory is c-Si/III-V semiconductors-based cells which are also known as ﬁrst gen- eration solar cells. The cells falling into this category have active absorbing material either c-Si or III-V semiconductors like gallium arsenide (GaAs)/Indium phosphide (InP), etc. These ﬁrst generation solar cells can be further categorized as single junction or multi-junction solar cells. In single junction solar cell, there is only one p/n junction and one type of active absorbing material like mono c-Si/ multi c-Si or GaAs or InP is used. The p/n junction usually has a p-type and a n-type layer of same material (homojunction). In multi-junction solar cells, more than one p/n junction is used with the help of more than one active absorbing material with active absorbing material band gap in decreasing order from top to bottom. Some examples of single junction ﬁrst generation solar cells are mono c-Si, multi c-Si, GaAs, InP-based solar cells. Examples of multi-junction solar cells are GaInP/GaAs (double junction), GaInAsP/GaIn (double junction), GaInP/GaAs/InGaAs (triple junction), GaInP/GaAs/GaInAs/GaInAs (four junctions), etc., where GaInP repre- sents gallium indium phosphide, GaInAsP represents gallium indium arsenide phosphide, GaInAs represents gallium arsenide, and GaIn represents gallium indium compound semiconductor. The second category solar cells are referred as thin ﬁlm solar cells. In this type, the active absorbing material thickness is few microns and these cells may have p/n 1.2 Historical Development of Solar Cells 5 junction with p-type and n-type layer of same material (homojunction) or of two different materials (heterojunction). Some examples are Copper Indium Gallium Selenide (CIGS), Cadmium Telluride (CdTe), and hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) based cells. The third category of cells is grouped in emerging PV technologies as these technologies have been recently realized and the used active absorbing materials characteristics are still being explored. Some examples of emerging PV technolo- gies are organic solar cells, quantum dot solar cells, dye-sensitized solar cells, perovskite-based cells, etc. In organic solar cells, organic compounds, like PTB7, PCBM, are used as active absorbing material (Liu et al. 2014). In quantum dot solar cells, nanoscale sizes of material (quantum dots), like PbS, CdTe, etc. (Shen et al. 2015; Ko et al. 2016), are used as active absorbing material. In dye-sensitized solar cells, dye, e.g., ruthenium polypyridine (Pellegrin et al. 2011) are used. And in perovskite-based cells, materials having perovskite structure (ABX3), e.g., methy- lammonium lead trihalide (CH3NH3PbX3), X can be iodine (I), bromine (Br) or chlorine (Cl), are used (Dualeh et al. 2014; Liu et al. 2015). 1.4 Current Status of Solar Cell Technologies There are different types of solar cells which have been developed over the time and continuous efforts are being put to make them more and more cost-effective and efﬁcient.

Figure 1.4 shows different notable solar cell technologies which have achieved big milestone and their best research cell world record efﬁciency reported till date (Green et al. 2015; NREL 2016). Mono c-Si solar cells have achieved world record efﬁciency of 25% on large device area. Mono c-Si solar cell with HIT (heterojunction with intrinsic thin layer) technology has also reached 25.6% efﬁciency mark which is world record on large device area with c-Si wafer-based solar cell technology. Multi c-Si-based solar cells have achieved 21.3% mark on large device area. All these cells have been measured under standard test condition (STC) in 1 sun intensity. With light concentration technology, mono c-Si solar cells have been reported to give efﬁciency as high as 27.6% in concentrated light equivalent to 92 suns (92X) on device designated illumination area of 1 cm2. Concentrator PV technology-based cells generally have small area and light is concentrated on the cell with the help of concentration optics (using less and mirror) which can be externally arranged or integrated with the device itself. The concentrator solar cells are well designed such that it can sustain high temperature when functioning under large intensity. Further, GaAs-based technology have been reported to show efﬁciency as high as 27.5% under 1 sun intensity, and using light concentration technology with light intensity equivalent to 117 suns (117X), it have been reported to show 29.1% efﬁciency. Another III-V semiconductor-based cell, i.e. InP, has been reported with 22.1% efﬁciency having total device area of 4 cm2 (Green et al. 2015; NREL 2016).

(data based on Ref. Green et al. 2015; NREL 2016) 1.4 Current Status of Solar Cell Technologies 7 In multi-junction-based solar technology, GaInP/GaAs/InGaAs-based triple junction solar cell with device aperture area of 1 cm2 have been reported with 37.9% efﬁciency under 1 sun and with 44.4% efﬁciency for concentrator PV-based technology with 302 suns (302X) on designated illumination area of about 0.17 cm2. In thin ﬁlm technology, CIGS solar cell technology has been reported to give highest efﬁciency of 22.3% followed by CdTe thin ﬁlm technology which has shown 21.5% efﬁciency at research level. a-Si: H-based solar cells have been reported with best stabilized efﬁciency of 13.6% (Green et al. 2015; NREL 2016). Under Emerging PV technology category, Dye-sensitized solar cell technology, which was ﬁrst reported in 1991(ORegan and Grätzel 1991), has reached 11.9% world record efﬁciency mark on designated illumination area of 1 cm2. Organic solar cell technology has achieved 11.5% efﬁciency mark which is more than twice when compared to reported world record efﬁciency mark in 2001. Quantum dot-based solar cells have been reported with recent best research cell efﬁciency of 10.6%. A noble perovskite based solar cell which was ﬁrst reported in 2009 (Kojima et al. 2009) with efﬁciency of 3.8% have reached 21% mark but shown to have unstabilized performance. Stability of perovskite-based solar cell is currently a big challenge as its performance degrade very rapidly in presence of moisture (Sivaram et al. 2015; Bryant et al. 2016). 1.5 Basic Working Principle of Solar Cells The basic requirement for a solar cell is to have an active absorbing material which absorbs light and generates free electrons (e). And, there should be appropriate contacts to collect the electrons from the device. Figure 1.5a shows the most general design for a solar cell. For an efﬁcient solar cell, there are three important processes, i.e., light absorption or light trapping, charge carrier generation, and charge carrier collection. All these processes have to be efﬁcient (Fig. 1.5b). The ﬁrst important requirement is efﬁcient light absorption. To get better output in terms of photon energy to electrical energy conversions, the input energy must be delivered efﬁciently to the active absorbing material which absorbs the light and produces electronhole (e-h) pairs. Efﬁcient light trapping in solar cell would mean minimization of reﬂection from front surface, maximization of light absorption in active material, and minimization of transmission across the active absorbing material. The next important requirement for efﬁcient solar cell is an effective charge carrier generation. It requires high-quality active absorbing material (de- fectless and contaminant-free material). The third important requirement of an efﬁcient solar cell is effective charge carrier collection. It makes the passivation layers and metal contacts as important parts of operation. To maximize the solar cell performance of any type of solar cell, all the three operations should be executed efﬁciently by solar cells. The design of solar cells and choice of various materials used in solar cell fabrication should be done keeping above points in mind. 8 1 Solar Cells Overview and Perspective to Light-Trapping Schemes Further, different types of solar cells may have different arrangements for efﬁcient light trapping. For example, in c-Si solar cell, the surface of the active absorbing material (c-Si wafer) is made rough to randomize the incident light which increases the optical path length in c-Si material (the active absorbing material) and helps in reﬂection minimization, overall it results in maximization of the light absorption. In thin ﬁlm technology, glass substrates, through which light enters into the thin ﬁlm active absorbing material, are made rough. Rough glass surface randomize the incident light and increases the optical path length into the active absorbing material. It helps in minimization of the reﬂection and maximization of the light absorption. Now let us discuss about the generation of charge carriers in active absorbing material. The main and essential requirement for generation of charge carriers is that the photons should be absorbed in the active absorbing material and it should excite electrons directly from low energy state to high energy state. These excited electrons then should travel to the charge collectors (contacts). The photon absorption, excitation of electron from ground state to excited state, and transport to contacts in active absorbing material may vary in different types of solar cell technology. For example, in p/n junction-based c-Si solar cell (more detail about p/n junction solar cell has been discussed in Chap. 2), the photon absorption occur throughout the active absorbing material (c-Si) and electron is excited from valance band (V.B) to conduction band (C.B). During the photovoltaic operation, electrons ﬂow from p-type region to n-type region (see Fig. 1.6a). Also, excitation of electron from V.B to C.B results in a deﬁciency of electron in V.B which is imagined as hole Charge carrier collector (-) AcƟve absorbing material Charge carrier collector (+) Photons Eﬃcient Light Trapping Eﬃcient charge carrier generaƟon Eﬃcient charge carrier collecƟon Eﬃcient solar cell (a) (b) Fig. 1.5 a Most general design for solar cell; b three important processes to be optimized for making efﬁcient solar cell 1.5 Basic Working Principle of Solar Cells 9 (absence of electron). The motion of hole happens in opposite direction of the electron motion (see Fig. 1.6a). However, in case of dye-sensitized solar cell technology, the photon absorption does not occur throughout the volume as in p/n junction solar cell, rather, it is absorbed at dye molecules attached to the porous titanium medium. This results in excitation of electron from ground state to high energy state within the dye molecule (Green 2002b). The excited electron is then transferred to the conduction band of the adjacent titania (TiO2) (see Fig. 1.6b) and transported to the contact from where it is to be collected. The dye in which the electron was excited and transferred to titania is again recharged by electron from counter electrode though liquid medium (electrolyte) (see Fig. 1.6b). Further, the e-h pair generated within the active absorbing material may behave differently in different active absorbing materials. For example, in c-Si solar cells at room temperature, the e-h pairs are bound with each other which form exciton and move as a pair within the material until broken by internal ﬁeld. However, in case of perovskite, it has been reported that at room temperature, the electrons and holes are present in free form rather than exciton due to low e-h pair binding energy (DInnocenzo et al. 2014). In summary, different materials used as active absorbing material in solar cells behave differently to perform various basic operations of solar cells, i.e., light trapping, charge carrier generation and collection. Therefore, the optimized con- ditions for making efﬁcient solar cell cannot be generalized. 1.6 Why c-Si Solar Cell? Why c-Si solar cells accounts for 8590% solar photovoltaic market today and is the most preferred technology than any other solar cell technology? There are many reasons for it. The evolution of c-Si cell technologies has beneﬁted from the Photon C.B p-type n-type V.B p/n Junction TiO2 Dye Counter electrode Electrolyte soluƟon V.B C.B Electron (e) Hole (h) Photon (a) (b) Fig. 1.6 Photon absorption and electron (e) and hole (h) generation and transport a in p/n junction based c-Si solar cell; b in Dye-sensitized solar cell 10 1 Solar Cells Overview and Perspective to Light-Trapping Schemes development of microelectronics industry. Many processes that are developed for microelectronics industry were directly adopted by c-Si cell industry, which resulted in continuous improvement of cell efﬁciencies. C-Si cells are made of abundant material and the material is nontoxic, which is not the case for other competitive solar cell technologies. But more importantly, the performance of c-Si cell technology at industry scale is best compared to any other technology, with similar investment. As described in Sect. 1.4, there are many technologies like GaAs-based multi-junction solar cells, GaAs single junction cells which offer better cell efﬁciency but these technologies are more costly than the c-Si-based technology and economically not viable for terrestrial applications. The c-Si solar cells are very stable and have lifetime of about 25 years. The only drawback of c-Si solar cell technology was poor absorption of light for which use of more c-Si material and hence thicker wafers are necessary. The need of relative thicker material as com- pared to other solar cell technologies results in signiﬁcant cost of the active material itself. However, with time there has been signiﬁcant development in process technologies to enhance the light absorption and collection of photogenerated carriers in c-Si solar cells. The introduction of surface texturization for light trap- ping in 1954 and introduction of silicon nitride as passivation layer and screen printing for contacts in 1980s along with the reduction in cost of c-Si wafers took the c-Si solar cell technology to new height with enhancement in efﬁciency and performance which resulted in further reduction in cost of the cell from about $76 per Watt in 1977 to $1012 per Watt in 2012(Economist.com 2012) (see Fig. 1.7). Presently, the c-Si solar cell average cost is $0.33 per Watt (Energytrend 2016) which is competitive with any other technology. There are efforts worldwide to reduce the cost of c-Si cell further. One of the way to reduce the cost of c-Si cell is by reducing the material used, which is achieved by making c-Si wafer thinner. The standard thickness of wafer currently Fig. 1.7 c-Si solar cell price over the years (after Ref. Economist.com 2012; Energytrend 2016) 1.6 Why c-Si Solar Cell? 11 used is 180 lm, which accounts for more than 50% of the solar cell manufacturing cost (ITRPV 2015). Making solar cells using thinner wafers raises many challenge schemes and implementing light trappings in thinner wafers is one of the important challenges to overcome. 1.7 Importance of Light-Trapping Structure Every solar cell has an active absorbing material volume which is an essential requirement of a solar cell where light is absorbed and charge carriers are generated which contributes to the electrical output. When light passes through the active absorbing material of the cell, some light is reﬂected from the front surface, some gets transmitted and some gets absorbed. As per BeerLambert law, if the incident light intensity of wavelength k is Io(k) and transmitted light intensity of wavelength k is I(k) (see Fig. 1.8), the absorption in the active absorbing material can be given by following Eq. (1.1): A ¼ I0  I I0 ¼ 1  I Io ¼ 1  expðatÞ; ð1:1Þ wherea is absorption coefﬁcient of the material and is a wavelength dependent parameter. t is the thickness of the active absorbing material. Equation (1.1) suggests that the absorption in the active absorbing material depend on the absorption coefﬁcient of the material and thickness of the material. Higher value of a leads to more light absorption in the material and would result in more charge carrier generation. Larger thickness of material also absorbs more light and hence more charge carrier generation. a is considered as characteristic property of a material. Since a is different for different wavelengths, it is important that the active absorbing material selection should be such that it absorbs maximum available photons in the solar spectrum reaching on the earth surface. Figure 1.9a shows the spectral photon irradiance falling on earth surface per unit square meters per second per unit wavelength. Maximum photon density is in 3002000 nm wavelength range with peak at around 550600 nm. Now lets consider the case of AcƟve absorbing material Io(λ) I(λ) Fig. 1.8 Schematic of light of wavelength k and intensity Io passing through an active absorbing material volume 12 1 Solar Cells Overview and Perspective to Light-Trapping Schemes Si, which is indirect band gap semiconductor, and GaAs, which is direct band gap semiconductor, as solar cell active absorbing material. The band gap of Si is 1.12 eV and for GaAs is around 1.39 eV. It means Si can absorb light having energy above 1.12 eV, i.e., all the photons of wavelength between 300 and 1120 nm can be absorbed. Similarly, GaAs can absorb light having energy above 1.39 eV, i.e., all the photons of wavelength between 300 and 900 nm can be absorbed. Also, the absorption coefﬁcient of Si and GaAs is shown in Fig. 1.9b, indicates much better absorption probability in direct band gap material like GaAs than the indirect band gap like Si. Further, lets compare Si and GaAs as an active absorbing material targeting the radiations in 3001200 nm wavelength range. Accounting the wavelength depen- dent absorption coefﬁcient of these two materials, the maximum current that can be generated from c-Si and GaAs based cells having different thickness can be seen in Fig. 1.10a, b. In a solar cell when there is no light-trapping structure, optical thickness of the cell would be equivalent to the geometrical thickness as the light will not go through multiple bounce within the active absorbing material. In such case, the maximum current which can be expected from a 200 lm c-Si-based cell would be 38.9 mA/cm2 and from GaAs solar cell of same thickness would be 35.1 mA/cm2. Despite being direct band gap semiconductor, GaAs-based cell would be able to generate lower current than Si which is due to its larger band gap compared to Si. However, the important aspect to consider here is the current generation potential in c-Si-based solar cell which is very much dependent of the cell thickness and it decreases as the thickness of the cell decreases (see Fig. 1.10a). In case of GaAs, after 100 lm material thickness, the variation in current generation is not signiﬁcant (see Fig. 1.10b) which is due to high absorption coefﬁcient of GaAs making it to absorb most of the light in thinner material. For very low thickness of GaAs material, some gain in current generation can be achieved with the help of Fig. 1.9 a Spectral photon irradiation of different wavelengths falling on earth surface (AM 1.5G) (after Ref. Standard IEC 60904-3 2008); b wavelength dependent absorption coefﬁcient of silicon (Si) and gallium arsenide (GaAs) (after Ref. Aspnes and Studna 1983; Green and Keevers 1995) 1.7 Importance of Light-Trapping Structure 13 light-trapping structure where the optical thickness is increased by making light to take multiple bounce or holding the light for longer time within the active absorbing material. In general, the c-Si-based cell would be much more beneﬁted by use of light-trapping structure than GaAs-based cell as the impact on current generation potential in GaAs-based cell would be very less inﬂuenced with multiple bounce of light until it is sufﬁciently thin (see Fig. 1.10a, b). To harvest wide range of wavelengths (3002000 nm) for light to electricity conversion, multi-junction approach, where multi-junction of different active absorbing materials are used with decreasing band gap from top to bottom as in GaInP/GaAs/InGaAs based triple junction solar cells, would be more appropriate. However, for single junction c-Si solar cells where the wavelengths of interest are 3001200 nm, much more gain in current can be targeted with suitable light-trapping structure. The expected maximum current density from a 200 lm c-Si solar cell without any light-trapping structure would be 38.9 mA/cm2 and it would decrease further when the thickness of the cell would decrease (see Fig. 1.10a). However, the solar current density for 3001200 nm range is about 46.6 mA/cm2 under AM 1.5G spectrum considering that each photon generate one electronhole pair which contribute to the current. It means that there are many opportunities for improvement in c-Si solar cell performance using appropriate light-trapping structure. Thus the need and importance of the light-trapping struc- ture to make light stay longer within the active absorbing material in case of indirect band gap materials like c-Si can be understood. And when reduction in c-Si wafer thickness are being aimed to save the c-Si material and hence to reduce the cell manufacturing cost, role of light-trapping structure become much more important. There are many different techniques for enhancement of light trapping within c-Si solar cell has been explored and many other new concepts and designs are being Fig. 1.10 Maximum current that can be generated under single and multiple light bouncing in a c-Si-based solar cell of different thickness; b. GaAs-based solar cell of different thickness 14 1 Solar Cells Overview and Perspective to Light-Trapping Schemes explored worldwide. In this book, traditional as well as advanced light-trapping structures in context of c-Si solar cells has been covered in subsequent chapters with their future prospects. Such light-trapping structures can be useful for other solar cell technologies too where whole idea of having light-trapping structure is to get optical path length enhancement or holding the light for longer time so that light absorption in the cell active absorbing material can be better. In c-Si solar cell technology, the trend is to reduce the cell manufacturing cost by reducing the wafer thickness. In such scenario, development of appropriate light-trapping structure becomes essential considering the indirect band gap nature of c-Si materials. Different techniques like surface texturing, plasmonics-based forward and backward light scattering, surface plasmon polariton (SSP) based light coupling, etc., are being explored for achieving better and efﬁcient light trapping by enhancing the optical path length or holding the light for longer time in c-Si solar cells. 1.8 Questions and Problems 1.

It explores development in design and technology of the c-Si solar cells from traditional to advanced device architecture. It highlights the historical development in cell design and technology along with the technological approach which are being researched for next generation c-Si solar cells. Starting from most general cell architecture to complex architecture design, like HIT and PERL cells, has been covered. In this chapter, both mono- as well as multi c-Si wafer-based cells and their development have been discussed along with the manufacturing process sequence which is widely followed. Some basics on solar cell performance and corresponding cell performance tracking parameters like open circuit voltage, short circuit current, maximum power point, FF, Efﬁciency, EQE and IQE, etc., and their interdepen- dence has also been discussed. Toward the end of the chapter, International Technology Roadmap for Photovoltaic (ITRPV) has been introduced. Also, dis- cussion on next-generation c-Si wafer-based solar cells technology has been done highlighting the complications and importance of study on advanced light trapping in such structures. 2.1 Overview of c-Si Solar Cells First c-Si solar cell was made in 1941. Back then the c-Si solar cell was merely 1% efﬁcient (Green 2009). The c-Si-based solar cell technology has now reached 25% efﬁciency mark and even crossed this mark (Green et al. 2015). This development has come due to continuous efforts to make solar cell design, material quality, passivation technologies, and light tapping architectures better and better. The cost reduction with better efﬁciency has been the focus of the c-Si-based solar cell technology development to make solar cells more cost-effective and affordable to the masses. Today, c-Si solar cell-based modules; mainly mono c-Si and multi c-Si, shares 8590% global market (Tanaka 2010). The ﬁrst solar cell was fabricated  Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017 C.S. Solanki and H.K. Singh, Anti-reﬂection and Light Trapping in c-Si Solar Cells, Green Energy and Technology, DOI 10.1007/978-981-10-4771-8_2 17 using mono c-Si wafers, however, multi c-Si-based solar cell technology, as the cheaper and available alternative, came into existence in 1974 (Treble 1998). Improvement in slicing technology and reduced kerf loss leads to manufacturing of solar cell on 180 µm wafers compared to 400 µm thickness wafers used in early years. The cost of c-Si-based cells has been declining over the years as the tech- nology becoming more mature (see Fig. 2.1). This is also in sync with reduction in wafer prices. The processing cost of cell manufacturing was further reduced after introduction of screen printing technology for contacts in 1975. The cell size also played a role in reduction in cell prices. In the beginning (around 1970s), the industrial cell size used to be mono c-Si wafer-based 50 mm circular cells (Treble 1998). These days, 125 and 156 mm pseudosquare cells are available in the market. Even up to 300 mm multi c-Si-based cells has also been produced by some man- ufactures(Treble 1998). Figure 2.1 shows the trend of annual fall in prices of multi c-Si based solar cells and wafer in the recent years in USD/Wp. Note that the multi c-Si-based solar cells are relatively less efﬁcient than the mono c-Si-based cell, however, the lower processing cost of multi c-Si-based cells makes it more preferable. In 1985, the best multi c-Si cell efﬁciency was in the range of 1516%, whereas mono c-Si-based cell were shown to have efﬁciency about 19%. As per recent reports, best multi c-Si-based cell have reached 21.3% efﬁciency mark and mono c-Si-based cell at 25% mark having large area (Green et al. 2015; NREL 2016). Figure 2.2 shows research cell or laboratory cell efﬁ- ciency improvements of mono- and multi c-Si-based cells over the years. Though the best efﬁciency in labs has crossed the 25% mark, the industrial cells are in 2122% efﬁciency range (Green et al. 2015). Continuous efforts are being given to make this technology more efﬁcient and affordable by researching and implementing the noble technologies for wafer manufacturing and cell processing. Fig. 2.1 Price trend of multi c-Si wafer and cells in recent years (after Ref. (www.itrpv. net/Reports/Downloads/2014/ 2014)) 18 2 c-Si Solar Cells: Physics and Technology 2.2 c-Si Solar Cell: Design and Technology 2.2.1 Classiﬁcation of c-Si-Based Solar Cells c-Si solar cells are mainly divided into two categories, e.g., mono c-Si solar cell and multi-crystalline Si solar cells. This classiﬁcation is based on the type of wafer used in fabrication of the cell. i. Mono c-Si solar cell: In mono c-Si solar cells, mono-crystalline wafers are used. These wafers have well-arranged atoms in crystallographic structure which is free from any grain boundaries. Figure 2.3a shows the plain view of a typical mono c-Si wafer and Fig. 2.3b shows symbolic microscopic view of wafer where atoms of Si are arranged in periodic manner and connected with each with covalent bond. Czochralski (Cz) technique and ﬂoat zone (FZ) techniques are most commonly used for manufacturing mono c-Si ingots from high-purity polycrystalline Si. The typical manufactured mono c-Si wafers have circular shape due to technicality involved in manufacturing of ingots which comes out in cylindrical shape (see Fig. 2.4a). But for economic beneﬁts in making PV modules, the wafers are cut from ingots such that it gets pseudosquare shape, as much as possible. While making the mono c-Si ingots, dopants are added to make it either p-type (mainly B (Boron) is used as dopants) of n-type (mainly P (Phosphorus) is used as dopant). Both p-type and n-type mono c-Si wafers are used for making solar cells. ii. Multi-/poly-crystalline solar cells: In multi/poly c-Si solar cells, multi-crystalline wafers are used. These wafers have many well-arranged atoms in crystallographic structure; crystal size typically varies in the range from mm to cm, separated by grain boundaries. Figure 2.3c shows the Fig. 2.2 Improvement trend in research cell efﬁciency of mono- and multi c-Si-based cells over the years (after Ref. (NREL 2016)) 2.2 c-Si Solar Cell: Design and Technology 19 (a) (c) (b) (d) Silicon atoms covalent bonds Fig. 2.3 a Plain view of a mono c-Si wafer; b symbolic microscope view for atomic arrangements in mono c-Si wafer; c plain view of a multi/poly c-Si wafer; d symbolic microscope view for atomic arrangements in multi c-Si wafer Wafer sawing process Mono c-Si ingot Poly c-Si ingot Mono c-Si wafers MulƟ c-Si wafers (a) (b) Fig. 2.4 Schematic of a Mono c-Si ingots and circular wafers after sawing process; b multi c-Si ingots and rectangular wafers after sawing process 20 2 c-Si Solar Cells: Physics and Technology pain view of a typical multi/poly c-Si wafer and Fig. 2.3d shows symbolic microscopic view of wafer where atoms of Si are arranged in periodic manner in small grain sizes separated by grains of different sizes. Due to presence of grains, the wafer looks nonuniform in color across the wafer and grain boundaries can be easily distinguished. The method for making puriﬁed poly-Si for multi c-Si wafers is the same as that of mono c-Si wafers; however, conversion of poly-Si into crystalline Si is done by directional solidiﬁcation method. In this method, it is possible to make square-shaped ingots and hence square and rectangular wafers (see Fig. 2.4b) which are beneﬁcial when manufacturing PV modules. Just like mono c-Si wafers, the multi c-Si wafers can also be p-type and n-type. The process used for manufacturing the poly/multi c-Si wafers are simpler and cost-effective, however, the efﬁciency achieved in these types of wafer-based cells are typically 12% lower than that of mono c-Si wafer-based cells produced with the same process. Figure 2.5a shows a typical 5-inch mono c-Si solar cell and Fig. 2.5b shows a typical 5-inch multi c-Si solar cells. Clear difference can be seen from surface and edges, mainly corners. 2.2.2 Architecture of c-Si Solar Cells A typical c-Si solar cell has a p-type or n-type base which is also known as base or substrate and is moderately doped with impurity (B or P respectively) doping concentration of *10151016/cm3. The junction (also called Emitter) is formed by highly doped region (impurity concentration *1020/cm3). The Emitter is of n-type for p-type base and p-type for n-type base. In order to reduce the reﬂection from the surface there is textured surface with anti-reﬂection coating, which also acts as Fig. 2.5 Front view camera image of a typical a mono c-Si solar cell; b multi c-Si solar cell 2.2 c-Si Solar Cell: Design and Technology 21 surface passivation layer. And, then there are metal contacts at the front and at the rear side. Figure 2.6a shows schematic of a typical p-type c-Si solar cell and Fig. 2.6b shows schematic of a typical n-type c-Si solar cell. In p-type c-Si solar cell as in Fig. 2.6a, base is p-type and emitter is made by heavy doping of pentavalent dopant usually phosphorus which form n+ region and makes p-n junction. The p-n junction helps to separate the charge carriers (electrons (e) and holes (h)) which are gen- erated when light is absorbed in the base. Cell surface is textured to enhance the light absorption in solar cell. Dielectric coating is done to passivate the dangling bond present at the surface of Si. If the surface is not passivated, the dangling bonds would act as recombination centers for photogenerated charge carriers and would reduce the electrical performance of the cell. The dielectric, usually silicon nitride (SiNx) or silicon oxide (SiOx)/silicon nitride (SiNx) stack, also act as anti-reﬂection coating. For back contact usually Aluminum (Al) is used. When cell is annealed to form proper contact, Al reacts with Si and form p+ region at based which serves the purpose of passivation at back surface, known as back surface ﬁeld passivation (BSF). For front contact, usually silver (Ag) is used to make ﬁngers and bus bars (see Fig. 2.5). Similarly in n-type cells (Fig. 2.6b), base is n-type and emitter is made by doping trivalent dopant usually boron which form p+ region. In this case also surface is textured to enhance the light absorption and dielectric coating (SiNx or SiOx/SiNx or aluminum oxide (Al2O3)) is done to passivate the dangling bond present at the surface which also acts as anti-reﬂection coating. For back contact, usually Aluminum (Al) is used here also. However, for BSF in this case, phos- phorus doping is preferred to form n+ region which acts as BSF. For front contact, usually Al or Ag is used to make ﬁngers and bus bars. Please note that the architecture shown here for n-type solar cell is more generic. There are many other possible architectures which are followed. p-type Si Al Front contact (Fingers/Busbar) Ag/Al Back contact BSF layer n+ layer Textured Surface for light trapping n-type Si Al p+ layer ARC layer (a) (b) Fig. 2.6 Schematic of a typical a p-type c-Si solar cell; b n-type c-Si solar cell 22 2 c-Si Solar Cells: Physics and Technology 2.2.3 Historical Development The early c-Si-based p-n junction solar cell came into existence in 1941 at Bell Laboratory by Russel Ohl (Green 2002). The reported solar cell has grown-in junction which is formed by impurity segregation in slowly recrystallized silicon melts. Figure 2.7 shows schematic of a typical grown-in p-n junction solar cell reported in 1941. The efﬁciency of such cell was less than 1% (Green 2009). The history of modern c-Si solar cell starts from 1954, when Fuller, Pearson, and Chaplin found that a diffuse p-n junction generated current when it is exposed to light (Treble 1998). The cell analysis then indicated 4.5% efﬁciency (Treble 1998). In 1956, a team led by Dr. Morton Prince at Hoffman Electronics of Evanston started commercial production of p/n junction cell which was 7% efﬁcient (Treble 1998). The cell size was 1 cm  2 cm and had single positive strip contact. The schematic of the cell is shown in Fig. 2.8. The cell also had silicon oxide (SiOx) coating at the top. In the beginning, the cell cost was very high and use for terrestrial application was not practically encouraging. After ﬁrst public trail of silicon solar cell in 1956 in Bell rural carrier system, the next application is found in Vanguard I (ﬁrst solar-powered satellite launched in 1958) to power 5 mW back-up transmitter (Treble 1998). By 1961, the production level cell efﬁciency reached 11% with improvement in series resistance and fabrication processes. For space application, it was a necessity to use solar power and the issue of cell price was secondary. However, for terrestrial application, solar cell cost was driving force for its further development. After 1972, solar cells started getting attention as an alternate energy source for terrestrial applications when oil prices increased signiﬁcantly. In 1972, the concept of back surface ﬁeld passivation is introduced by NASA Lewis Research Center. In BSF, p+ impurity (e.g., aluminum) is driven into the back of the silicon wafer which results in impurity concentration gradient and helps to accelerate minority carriers generated in the base of the cell toward the junction and also improves the red response of the cell. With the help of BSF, it became possible to make thinner cells of thicknesses from 100 to 200 µm (Treble 1998). In 1974, a major improvement came from COMSAT Laboratories where they introduced surface texturing concept (Green et al. 1999). For surface texturing, the n-type p-type grown juncƟon rear contact (-) top contact (+) Fig. 2.7 Si solar cell based on grown-in junction due to segregation of impurities in slow recrystallization of silicon melt reported in 1941 (after Ref. (Green 2002)) 2.2 c-Si Solar Cell: Design and Technology 23 surface was selectively etched to form pyramids to eliminate the reﬂection losses from the cell surface. The combination of BSF and surface texturing along with introduction of junction depth reduction concept resulted in solar cell efﬁciency up to 15% in air mass (AM) zero condition (AM0) which is meant for space appli- cations. These types of cells shown 1617% efﬁciency in air mass 1.5 global (AM1.5G) radiation, i.e., for terrestrial applications (Green et al. 1999). In the direction of manufacturing cheaper cells, multi-crystalline silicon (c-Si) wafers were introduced in 1974 as an alternative to mono c-Si wafers for producing cells (Treble 1998). Also, improvement in wafer cutting technique led to manu- facture thinner wafers (400250 µm). Dramatic reduction in cell manufacturing cost was seen after introduction of screen printing technology for contacts which replaced the costly photolithographic masking and vacuum deposition process requirements. By 1980s, screen printing technology had become well adapted for contact fabrication in cells. The multi c-Si wafer-based cell with screen printed contact made the cells commercially viable for terrestrial applications. In 1975, the terrestrial c-Si solar cells had achieved 10% efﬁciency (under AM 1.5 conditions) for mono c-Si- and 8% multi c-Si-based materials. In 1982, Passivated Emitter Solar Cell (PESC) was reported by Dr. M.A. Green research group from UNSW. It had 23 nm thin SiO2 insulator on the front surface (see Fig. 2.9a). The thin SiO2 insulator was used to reduce the recombination of generated carriers at front. This design modiﬁcation resulted in improvement in open circuit voltage enhancement from 614 to 690 mV under standard test con- ditions (STC) which resulted in achieving the 16% efﬁciency mark (Treble 1998). Further design modiﬁcations were done in PESC cell structure, e.g., reduction in front contact metallization (see Fig. 2.9b) and process reﬁnement, which helped to achieve the 19.1% efﬁciency mark under AM1.5 condition by 1985. Incorporation of microgrooved surface further raises the efﬁciency to 20.9%. These cells were fabricated using ﬂoat zone wafers and contacts were made using photolithographic mask and vacuum deposition technique. Though the techniques used in these cell fabrications were costly, but it showed the way and the potential to achieve high efﬁciency. In 1985, Dr. M.A. Green research group from UNSW came up with cheaper process option to fabricate high-efﬁciency cells. These cells were called buried contact cell (see Fig. 2.9c) made from mono c-Si p-type Czochralski (CZ) Si wafers which were much cheaper than ﬂoat zone wafers. These cells have textured surface, an oxide layer, BSF layer, plated Ni/Cu contact buried in laser scribed slots n-Si p-Si Contact strip SiOx AR coaƟng Back contact (solder-dipped Ni plate) Fig. 2.8 Early p/n junction cell (1956) by Hoffman Electronics of Evanston (after Ref. (Treble 1998)) 24 2 c-Si Solar Cells: Physics and Technology (Treble 1998; Green et al. 1999). This cell design was shown to give 19.6% efﬁciency and was adopted by BP solar for industry scale production. M.A. Greens group in 1991 made PERL (passivated emitter and rear locally diffused; see Fig. 2.9d) cells having efﬁciency of 23.3% (Blakers et al. 1990; Treble 1998). It was fabricated using ﬂoat zone mono c-Si wafer and had inverted pyra- mids for reﬂection reduction and thin oxide layer on front as well as back for surface passivation (Green et al. 1999). It also had small contact area with highly doped p+ and n+ regions. Further process modiﬁcation and use of double layer antireﬂection (DLAR) coating in PERL cell resulted in 2425% efﬁciency (Zhao et al. 1996; Green 2009). Today, best multi c-Si-based cells have reached 21.3% efﬁciency mark and mono c-Si-based cells at 25% mark having large area (NREL 2016). c-Si-based solar cell with new cell design having heterojunction, known as HIT (heterojunction with intrinsic thin layer) cell, was also reported by Panasonic. It has marked world record efﬁciency of 25.6% (Green et al. 2015) which had been ﬁrst announced in 2013 with record efﬁciency of 24.7%. In HIT cell, an intrinsic (i-type) a-Si layer and a p-type a-Si layer deposited on a randomly textured n-type CZ c-Si wafer to form a p/n heterojunction as shown in Fig. 2.10 (Taguchi et al. 2014). The i-type and n-type a-Si layers deposited on the opposite side of the wafer resulted in a back surface ﬁeld structure (see Fig. 2.10). On both sides of the doped a-Si layers, transparent conductive oxide (TCO) layers and metal grid electrodes were used (Taguchi et al. 2014).

(Treble 1998)) (images not to scale) 2.2 c-Si Solar Cell: Design and Technology 25 2.3 Manufacturing Process of c-Si Solar Cells c-Si solar cell was the ﬁrst among various types of solar cells which came into existence and became widely used solar cell technology. The main reason behind becoming most preferred technology and its fast development was: a. Presence of well-established microelectronic industry. b. Simple processing requirement. c. Well understood physics behind its operation and performance impacting parameters. d. Stability and reliability of the device. The manufacturing of a c-Si solar cell has many unit processes depending upon the planned device structure. However, it is much lesser than the unit processes involved in many microelectronics device fabrications. For better and efﬁcient solar cell, each unit processes requires proper optimization. Here, we will discuss in brief the process steps involved in fabricating a typical solar cell to have a basic understanding of c-Si solar cell device fabrication. For fabricating c-Si wafer-based solar cell, start with c-Si wafer. It can be mono c-Si wafer or multi c-Si wafer. For manufacturing wafer, silica (SiO2), also known as sand, is used as raw material which is made from second most earth abundant element available on earth, i.e., silicon (Si). Silica is molten at high temperature and reduction with carbon gives metallurgical grade silicon which is about 97% pure. Further puriﬁcation process is done to reduce the elemental impurities and elec- tronic grade Si is achieved when the impurity present is less than parts per billion (ppb). Hydrogen chloride (HCl) is used to make trichlorosilane (SiHCl3) which is an intermediate compound of polysilicon manufacturing. SiHCl3 is further vapor- ized and diluted with hydrogen (H2) while passing it through deposition reactor, which transforms the material into elemental silicon which has impurity level less than 0.001 ppb. After this, the electronic grade poly silicon is used for fabricating mono- or multi c-Si ingots. For mono c-Si ingot manufacturing, the most widely used techniques are Czochralski (CZ) technique or Float Zone (FZ) technique. For multi c-Si ingot manufacturing the most widely used technique is Siemens c-Si (CZ, n-type, textured) p-type a-Si p-type a-Si i-type a-Si front electrode TCO Fig. 2.10 Schematic of a HIT cell (after Ref. (Taguchi et al. 2014)) 26 2 c-Si Solar Cells: Physics and Technology technique. The details of these techniques are not being discussed here as it is beyond the scope of the book. After manufacturing the ingots, the wafers are produced by wire sawing. Technological advancement in wafer cutting is important to make wafers thinner and with low kerf loss. Kerf loss is the loss of material (usually indicated in width) while cutting the wafers from ingots. Many techniques like wire electrical discharge machining and other kerf loss less processes are being explored (Dongre et al. 2015). Manufacturing of the wafers constitute a complete industry which supplies the wafers of desired quality and quantity to solar cell manufactures. Once the wafer is available, further process of manufacturing solar cell begins. Figure 2.11 shows the steps involved in manufacturing of a typical cell having geometry as shown in Fig. 2.12.

For saw damage removal, usually sodium hydroxide (NaOH) or potassium hydroxide (KOH) solution in deionized (DI) water is used at temperature of 7080 C. After saw damage removal, surface roughening/texturing process is done to reduce the reﬂection from the surface. In case of mono c-Si wafers, directional etching using chemical solution usually NaOH/KOH in DI water in the presence of isopropyl alcohol (IPA) is used. In case of multi c-Si wafers, acidic solution for texturing is used to form honeycomb-like structure on surface. In this case chemical solutions like hydroﬂuoric acid (HF) and nitric acid (HNO3) are widely used. After surface texturing, RCA cleaning step can be used. RCA process was ﬁrst developed at Radio Corporation of America and that is why the name RCA. RCA processes have two types. One is called RCA-1 which is a combination of DI water, ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH), and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). This process helps to remove residue of organic solvents from the surface of Si wafer. The other type is RCA-2 which is a combination of DI water, hydrogen chloride (HCl), and H2O2. It helps to remove crucial contaminant like gold (Au) which can introduce mid-gap trap states, which can severely impact the solar cell performance. This step is usually optional in industry process as it adds up to the cost of the cell. The next step is dopant diffusion for p/n junction formation. Phosphorous-based dopant (usually liquid source like phosphoryl trichloride (POCl3)) is used for p-type cells and boron-based dopant (usually liquid source like boron tribromide (BBr3)) for n-type cells. Diffusion process is done at high temperature usually 800900 C. Diffusion process optimization is done depending upon the requirement of the concentration of doping in the emitter of the cell. After diffusion process, glass removal (phosphorus silicate glass (PSG) in case of phosphorous-based dopant/borosilicate glass (BSG) in case of boron-based dopant) process is done. Usually, dilute HF solution is used for PSG/BSG removal. After glass removal step, edge isolation is done which helps to remove the conduction path from top and bottom layers which may have resulted in shunt. This step basically results in electrical isolation between emitter and rear base of the cell. Usually, laser/plasma etching-based techniques are used for edge isolation. In laser technique, edges of the cell are ﬁnely cut. In plasma technique, reactive ion etchant are used for etching the edges. After edge isolation, anti-reﬂection coating layer is used. The thickness and the refractive index is optimized such that it suits with the texture surface and result in minimum reﬂection from the surface. It also serves the purpose of passivation which is important for better performance of the cell. Depending upon the type (p-type/n-type), dielectric material is chosen. Usually, thermal oxide (SiO2), silicon nitride (SiNx), aluminum oxide (Al2O3), titanium dioxide (TiO2) are used. Also, combination of the dielectric layers of different thicknesses has been used for better cell performance. Most widely used technique for dielectric deposition is chemical vapor deposition (CVD). After dielectric layer deposition, contact printing is done. The most widely used technique for contact printing is screen printing. In cell contact printing, the back 28 2 c-Si Solar Cells: Physics and Technology surface is fully covered with metal and the front surface has ﬁngers and bus bars with optimized thickness and width so that it offers minimum series resistance and minimum metal shading to allow maximum light to reach the cell. For screen printing, usually aluminum (Al) and silver (Ag) paste is used which contain an organic binder, solvent, glass frit, and Ag/Al nanoparticle. Screen which used to print the contact on cell surface has wire netting usually stainless steel coated with emulsion. After printing, drying is done at 200250 C to remove the solvent. After contact printing and drying, contact co-ﬁring is done to ensure the ohmic contact of metal contacts with semiconductor. Usually, belt furnace is used which has different temperature zones ranging from 400 to 900 C. The cell move through the furnace on belt and passes through different temperature zones. In this process, the metal contacts get through dielectric layer at front surface and make contact with Si. And at the same time, Al at the back side, reacts with Si and forms BSF. Cell is ready now for measurement. 2.4 Photovoltaic Effect in c-Si Solar Cells and Important Parameters 2.4.1 Photovoltaic Effect in c-Si Solar Cells When light shines on a c-Si solar cell, the photons are absorbed in Si material and results in generation of electronhole (e-h) pairs. These e-h pairs move within the material until it sees a potential gradient, i.e., electric ﬁeld which is sufﬁcient to break the e-h paring. This phenomenon happens at p/n junction where there is potential gradient. In a p-type cell, the holes moves toward the back electrode and the electron are collected at front electrode as shown in Fig. 2.13a. Figure 2.13b p-type c-Si solar cell Back contact JL Photo generated electron Photo generated hole Photon JL Photo generated electron Photon C.B p-type n-type V.B p/n Junction Photo generated hole Eg (a) (b) Fig. 2.13 a Schematic of a eh pair generation and collection in typical p-type c-Si solar cell; b energy band diagram of a photovoltaic operation. C.B indicates conduction band and V.B indicates valance band. (Images not to scale) 2.3 Manufacturing Process of c-Si Solar Cells 29 shows the energy band diagram of a typical p-type c-Si solar cell photovoltaic operation. When light falls on solar cell, e-h pair is generated. The e-h pair moves toward the junction where it gets separated and is collected from electrodes. Here to note that only photons having energy larger than or equal to the band gap of Si (  1.12 eV) are absorbed (neglecting phonon-assisted absorption) and contribute to the e-h pair generation and photogenerated current (JL). 2.4.2 CurrentVoltage Characteristics In solar cell, the photogenerated current is maximum when there is no connected load. When the load is connected to the cell, the photogenerated current (JL) due to cell illumination results in voltage drop (V) across the load which biases the p/n junction in forward direction. The equivalent circuit diagram of a solar cell is shown in Fig. 2.14a in ideal case, where solar cell is combination of constant current source and a p/n junction diode in parallel as shown with load resistance (RL). The forward-biased p/n junction results in forward bias diode current (JD). But the photogenerated current (JL) is much larger than the forward bias diode current (JD) and it is in opposite direction to JD. Therefore, the net solar cell current under illuminated condition is in reverse direction of generated forward bias voltage. The solar cell operation is given by Eq. (2.1) where Jo is reverse saturation current density of the diode, q is electron charge, k is Boltzmann constant and T is temperature. J ¼ JD  JL ¼ J0½expðqV kTÞ  1  JL: ð2:1Þ The net current shown in Eq. (2.1) is in ideal case. But in realistic case, series and shunt resistance comes into picture which impacts the cell performance. A realistic case solar cell equivalent circuit diagram is shown in Fig. 2.14b. Here a shunt resistance (Rsh) is considered in parallel to the p/n junction diode which accounts for the various leakage currents in the solar cell due to different recom- bination effects. The series resistance (Rs) in series accounts for the various ohmic V RL JD J JL Rs Rsh V RL JD J JL (a) (b) Fig. 2.14 Solar cell equivalent circuit diagram in a ideal case; b realistic case 30 2 c-Si Solar Cells: Physics and Technology losses in the bulk material, at metalsemiconductor interface and contacts during current collection. In light of series and shunt resistance presence, the current voltage equation under illuminated condition is modiﬁed as given in Eq. (2.2) where the new variable n (ideality factor) is introduced which accounts for the nonideal p/n junction diode and Rs; Rsh are series and shunt resistance respectively. J ¼ J0½expðqðV  J:RsÞ nkT Þ  1 þ V  J:Rs Rsh  JL: ð2:2Þ Above Eq. (2.2) is based on single diode model, however multi diode models are also considered in order to account the various recombination phenomenon in the solar cell and the Eq. (2.2) is further modiﬁed and is given by Eq. (2.3) where each term of J0k and nk represent a particular recombination mechanism (Altermatt et al. 1996). J ¼ X m k¼1 J0k½expðqðV  J:RsÞ nkkT Þ  1 þ V  J:Rs Rsh  JL: ð2:3Þ In typical solar cell, the widely used model is two diode model which was ﬁrst introduced in 1963 by Wolf and Raushenbach (1963). The two diode model-based equivalent circuit is shown in Fig. 2.15a. And for illuminated condition, the cur- rentvoltage characteristic is given in Eq. (2.4). J ¼ J01½expðqðV  J:RsÞ n1kT Þ  1 þ J02½expðqðV  J:RsÞ n2kT Þ  1 þ V  J:Rs Rsh  JL: ð2:4Þ Here J01 and J02 are the saturation current densities through the two modeled diodes which separately represent recombination current densities of emitter/base, which dominates at high forward bias, and space charge region, which dominates at low forward bias, respectively (Pysch et al. 2007).

A typical current voltage (J-V) characteristic for a solar cell can be seen in Fig. 2.15b for both light/illuminated and dark measurement conditions. In dark condition, the photo- generated current (JL) would be zero. 2.4.3 Important Solar Cell Parameters 2.4.3.1 Open Circuit Voltage (Voc) When cell is illuminated and no current is drawn from the cell, the voltage obtained from the cell is called open circuit voltage (Voc) (at J = 0 in Fig. 2.15b).Voc is function of photogenerated current (JL), reverse saturation current (J0), ideality factor (n), and cell temperature (T). It is expressed in mathematical form as in Eq. (2.5). Voc ¼ nkT q lnðJL J0 þ 1Þ: ð2:5Þ Here Voc dependence on J0 makes it dependent on recombination effect in the cell. For better Voc from the cell, the recombination in the cell should be avoided. Voc is also inﬂuenced by temperature. Per degree centigrade increase in temperature of the cell results in about 1.7 mV reduction in Voc in case of c-Si-based solar cells (Goetzberger et al. 1998). 2.4.3.2 Short Circuit Current (Jsc) When cell is illuminated and short circuited, the current obtained from the cell is called short circuit current (Jsc) (at V = 0 in Fig. 2.15b). It is the maximum current that can be drawn from the cell. For Si-based cell, if all the photons are absorbed, about 46.6 mA/cm2 current can be expected (neglecting all electrical and optical losses) in AM 1.5G radiation (radiation falling on earth surface is 100 mW/cm2 in AM 1.5G condition). 2.4.3.3 Maximum Power (Pmax) Maximum power (Pmax) indicates the maximum achievable power from the solar cell when it is illuminated. It is the product of voltage (Vm) and current (Jm) at optimal operating point (see Fig. 2.15b). At Pmax, d(J.V)/dV = 0 and Pmax can be also be expressed in terms of Voc as given in Eq. (2.6). 32 2 c-Si Solar Cells: Physics and Technology Pmax = Vm:Jm¼ nkT q ln[ ð JLJoÞ þ 1 1 þ ð nkT q )Vm : Jm  ½Voc nkT q ln(1 + Vm ðnkT q Þ Þ: Jm: ð2:6Þ 2.4.3.4 Fill Factor (FF) Fill factor is deﬁned as the ratio of maximum achievable power (Pmax, i.e., Vm.Jm) from the device to the maximum power generation capacity of the device (i.e., Voc. Jsc). It is expressed as Eq. (2.7). FF ¼ Vm:Jm Voc:Jsc : ð2:7Þ FF of the cell is inﬂuenced by resistive losses and nonideal recombination in solar cells. It is also a measure of the p/n junction quality and series resistance (Rs) of the cell. Also, signiﬁcant shunt effect (Rsh  1000 Ω-cm2) in the cell would impact FF of the cell. In practical c-Si solar cells, FF mostly observed between 0.78 and 0.80 depending upon the quality of contact on the cell fabricated and the cell manufacturing process. Note that the poor contact quality may result in much lesser FF. 2.4.3.5 Efﬁciency (η) Quantitatively, efﬁciency is deﬁned as the ratio of output from a device to the input and is important parameter to quantify the device performance. In solar cell, the efﬁciency is deﬁned as ratio of maximum achievable power to the input power. It depends on the incident light intensity and spectrum as well as temperature of the cell. Terrestrial cells are measured under standard test conditions (STC) with simulated AM1.5G radiation. The cell temperature is kept at 25 C. For AM 1.5G spectrum, incident power (Pin) is 100 mW/cm2 and maximum achievable power from a device is Pmax (=Vm.Jm). Mathematically, Efﬁciency(η) is expressed as Eq. (2.8): g ¼ Pmax Pin ¼ Vm:Jm Pin ¼ FF:Voc:Jsc Pin : ð2:8Þ 2.4.3.6 Quantum Efﬁciency (QE) Quantum efﬁciency (QE) is used as a diagnostic tool to evaluate the solar cell performance. It helps in analyzing the cell performance quantitatively as well as 2.4 Photovoltaic Effect in c-Si Solar Cells and Important Parameters 33 qualitatively. Solar cell responds to different wavelengths differently. Photon of particular wavelength absorbed in solar cell generate e-h pair and depending upon the number of photons in spectrum for a particular wavelength, number of e-h pairs are generated. Percentage of photons of particular wavelength converted into e-h pairs which contribute to electrical current (collected from device) when the cell is short circuited is called quantum efﬁciency (QE). QE is further divided into two categories known as external quantum efﬁciency (EQE) and internal quantum efﬁciency (IQE). (i) External Quantum Efﬁciency (EQE): EQE is deﬁned as the ratio of number of electrons collected from solar cell under short circuit condition to the number of photons of particular wavelength incident on the cell. It is also known as Incident Photon to Current Efﬁciency (IPCE). EQE (in %) can be mathemati- cally expressed as Eq. (2.9): EQEðkÞ ¼ 1240  JL k  Pin  100; ð2:9Þ where k is incident photon wavelength in nm, JL is photogenerated current from the incident photon (in mA/cm2) and Pin is incident photon power (W/m2). (ii) Internal Quantum Efﬁciency (IQE): IQE is deﬁned as the ratio of number of electrons collected from solar cell under short circuit condition to the number of photons of particular wavelength absorbed by the cell. Note that IQE does not include the reﬂected or transmitted photons in account. IQE (in %) can be mathematically expressed as Eq. (2.10): IQEðkÞ ¼ EQEðkÞ ð1  R  TÞ  100; ð2:10Þ where R is reﬂectance from the cell and T is transmittance through the cell. In case of c-Si solar cell, back surface is fully covered with metal contact which makes T = 0% and the IQE is generally expressed as Eq. (2.11): IQEðkÞ ¼ EQEðkÞ ð1  RÞ  100: ð2:11Þ Here to note that IQE is corrected form of EQE which does not account for reﬂection losses in the cell and it is considered as better indicator of solar cell bulk material, the p-n junction, front and back surface passivation quality, etc. Since high-energy photons are absorbed near front surface of the cell, IQE at high-energy wavelengths indicates the junction and front surface passivation quality. Also, low-energy photons travel deep into the cell, IQE at lower energy wavelength 34 2 c-Si Solar Cells: Physics and Technology indicates the bulk property of the cell as well as the back surface passivation quality. In ideal case, IQE should be 100%, however, in realistic case; it is always less than 100% reﬂecting the loss of generated e-h in recombination. To get maximum performance from the cell, the cell should be designed such that the IQE be maximum for the wavelengths which are in abundance in the incident light spectrum. QE curve of a typical c-Si-based solar cell is shown in Fig. 2.16. One can see that for high-energy photons, IQE is less and this loss can be attributed to front surface recombination. Also, nonactive absorbing layer, e.g. ARC layers, may result in parasitic absorption leading to IQE loss. Also, at low-energy wavelengths, IQE loss can be seen which can be attributed to low absorption, low minority carrier lifetime, back surface recombination, etc. 2.5 Role of Light-Trapping Structures c-Si wafers are made up of silicon (Si) which is an indirect band gap semicon- ductor. Light absorption and corresponding excitation of an electron from valance band to conduction band is week in indirect band gap semiconductor as it does not satisfy the requirement of momentum conservation since top of the valence band and bottom of the conduction band does not occur on same momentum (k) in energy (E)momentum (k) diagram as shown in Fig. 2.17. To conserve the momentum, the optical absorption is assisted by phonon which is quantized lattice vibration. A phonon is either emitted or absorbed during the process of photon absorption (Pankove 1971) and result in electron transition from valance band to conduction band. Due to involvement of phonons in optical absorption, the absorption coefﬁcient of an indirect band gap semiconductor is proportional to energy band gap (Eg) and phonon energy (Ep) as per relation as given in Eq. 2.12 where E is photon energy (Sze and Ng 2006). Fig. 2.16 EQE, IQE and reﬂectance graph plot of a typical c-Si solar cell and IQE of a ideal c-Si PV cell 2.4 Photovoltaic Effect in c-Si Solar Cells and Important Parameters 35 aðEÞ / ðE  Eg  EpÞ2: ð2:12Þ Due to indirect band gap nature of Si, it weekly absorbs light especially at longer wavelength near its band gap where the absorption coefﬁcient is very small (Fig. 2.18a). Figure 2.18a shows the absorption coefﬁcient (a) of Si in cm1 along with absorption length (1/a), a length required to absorb light completely for a particular wavelength. It can be noticed that a 100-lm-thick c-Si wafer would be sufﬁcient to absorb light up to 950 nm wavelength. However, above 950 nm till band gap of Si (1.12 eV), much thicker material is required. For 1150 nm wave- length, the required thickness of material is about 10 mm. Using such thick material is infeasible, particularly from the perspective of cost.

(Green and Keevers 1995)) along with absorption length; b Maximum short circuit current that can be generated after multiple light passing through active absorbing material of c-Si solar cell of 200 lm thickness 36 2 c-Si Solar Cells: Physics and Technology When targeting cell using c-Si wafer, the wavelengths in solar spectrum which are of interest are 3001200 nm. In order to absorb this entire wavelength range, large thickness of wafer would be required. However, if light is made to travel back-and-forth in the solar cell (in active absorbing material), the optical thickness of the solar cell can be increased while keeping the geometrical thickness same. This can be used useful in reducing the thickness of the wafer required, which can be obtained by suitably optimized light-trapping structure. Figure 2.18b shows the maximum short circuit current that can be generated after multiple light passes through active absorbing material of c-Si solar cell of 200 lm thickness. For single pass, the maximum expected short circuit current is 38.9 mA/cm2 which is increased to 42.4 mA/cm2 for 8 passes and 44.0 mA/cm2 for 50 passes. It can be noticed that how an efﬁcient light-trapping structure can result in optical thickness increment of the cell keeping the same geometrical thickness (200 lm in present case), and hence increase in current generation capacity. This indicates the necessity of a suitable light-trapping structure in Si-based cell where cost-effectiveness and efﬁciency both are desired. The Si ﬂat surface results in reﬂection in the range of 3550%. In order to reduce reﬂection from Si surface, surface texturization is done where Si surface is inten- tionally made rough. In 1974, Haynos reported the ﬁrst evidence of reﬂection reduction in Si solar cell using Si surface texturing (Haynos et al. 1974). The cells were made using (100) Si wafer and anisotropic etching. These texturing-based cells resulted in efﬁciency of 15.015.5% under AM0 radiation which would be equivalent to 16.717.2% under AM1.5G radiation (Green et al. 1999). Yablonovitch and Cody (1982), Yablonovitch (1982) theoretically showed using statistical ray optics approach that light-trapping absorption can be enhanced maximum up to 4n2, where n is the refractive index, for weekly absorbing wave- lengths by surface roughening of a semiconductor surface. 2.6 ITRPV Roadmap for c-Si Solar Cell Development Global leaders in manufacturing of c-Si products, e.g., wafers, cells and modules, came together and created International Technology Roadmap for Photovoltaic (ITRPV). The ﬁrst ITRPV report result was published in 2010. The aim of ITRPV was to ensure constant efﬁciency increase along with the cost reduction with the help of technology advancements. ITRPV provides a common platform to discuss the sustainable PV market; guideline for whole c-Si PV technology supply chain (includes silicon, c-Si wafer, c-Si module, inverter, and PV system, etc.); ground for cooperation among the supply chain; guideline for material and equipment sup- pliers; target for R&D centers and PV standardization source; which are regularly updated. The topics presented in the ITRPV report are divided into three main areas, i.e., materials, process, and products. In this section we would discuss some of the proposed improvements in near further at cell level only. 2.5 Role of Light-Trapping Structures 37 The recent 2014 ITRPV reports (ITRPV 2015) indicate that poly silicon price has been reduced from 67 USD/kg in 2010 to 16.6 USD/kg in 2014, i.e., about 75% reduction in price in just 4 years and even further reduction in prices is indicated. In wafer sawing technology, slurry-based wafer sawing is dominating. However, diamond wire sawing is expected to gain market in near future with targeted kerf loss of less than 20 lm. Further, as per latest poly Si prices and wafer manufac- turing technology, wafer still accounts for 51% of the cost in cell price and need for technology to reduce the thickness of the wafer has been envisioned. Wafer thickness of 100120 lm range would possibly be in mass production made by 2025. Improvements in process technology have been aimed to reduce recombination losses in solar cells. Reduction in bulk recombination current (Jo,bulk) of the solar cell has been targeted from 350 to 100 fA/cm2 for p-type multi c-Si solar cell and from 250 to 50 fA/cm2 for p-type mono c-Si solar cells. Emphasis to improve rear side passivation of the cell has been given to improve the cell performance. Silicon oxynitride (SiONx)/Aluminum oxide (Al2O3) has been indicated as potential dielectric for back surface passivation. Also, reduction in silver mass by reducing contact ﬁnger width for contacts has been proposed along with introduction of copper (Cu) plating technology for contact fabrication as an alternative to Ag to make solar cell even more cheaper. 2.7 Next Generation c-Si Solar Cells For making solar cell cheaper, thinner wafer is being targeted for solar cell man- ufacturing and it is expected to be available in mass production by 2025. Top-down as well as bottom-up approaches are being actively researched for fabricating thin wafer-based c-Si solar cells. In bottom-up approach, epitaxial grown c-Si layer on substrates using porous layer transfer method are being explored. Layer transfer techniques consist of three important steps which are (Petermann et al. 2012): i. HF acid-based electrochemical pores etching into a silicon substrate wafer. ii. Epitaxial growth of mono c-Si layer on the porous silicon. iii. Separation of the epitaxial layer from the growth wafer. Recently, a 16.8% efﬁcient 18-lm silicon solar cell on steel substrate was demonstrated using such method where the 18 lm n-type silicon as active absorbing layer was expitaxially grown with 2 lm front surface n+ layer and 1 lm rear p+ layer with shallow texturing on the top (front surface) (Wang et al. 2014). The cell was having architecture more like PERL cells where the front contact was made using Ni-Cu plating through dielectric opening at front. Also, in another effort to make thin c-Si wafer-based cells, similar technique of porous layer transfer was followed to fabricate 43 lm thin c-Si solar cell which resulted in 19% efﬁciency. The schematic of the solar cell device structure is shown in Fig. 2.19a. 38 2 c-Si Solar Cells: Physics and Technology The cell has rear surface passivation using dielectric which is necessity for efﬁcient thin wafers-based solar cells. The back contact was made using local opening in dielectric and subsequent Al evaporation. Also, the front surface was textured and had about 4 lm random pyramids for light trapping. In top-down approach, different wafers cutting techniques are being explored to manufacture thin wafers with minimum kerf loss and ITRPV projects to have 100 120 lm thin wafers in mass production by 2025. Up to 25% efﬁciency cell on less than 100 lm thin c-Si wafer has been demonstrated recently (Taguchi et al. 2014). The solar cell is known as heterojunction with intrinsic thin layer (HIT) cell. The typical schematic of the HIT cell is shown in Fig. 2.19b. In HIT solar cell, p/n heterojunction is formed using intrinsic (i-type) amorphous silicon (a-Si) layer and a p-type a-Si layer deposited on a randomly textured n-type CZ c-Si wafer. The a-Si (n-type and i-type) deposited on the opposite side of the wafer provide back surface ﬁeld passivation. The high-quality intrinsic a-Si layer between the c-Si wafer and the doped a-Si layer helps to achieve very good surface passivation which is crucial in thin wafer-based solar cells. For contacts, transparent conductive oxide (TCO) layers and metal grid electrodes are fabricated on both sides. The trend of fabricating cost-effective and efﬁcient cell indicates that the next generation solar cells are going to be fabricated on much thinner (50100 lm) wafers. In such case, rear surface passivation and light-trapping structure would be p-type Si Al Al Al2O3 n+ layer 43 μm SiNx AlOx/SiNx stack c-Si (CZ, n-type, textured) p-type a-Si p-type a-Si i-type a-Si front electrode TCO (a) (b) Fig. 2.19 a Schematic of porous layer transfer based 43 lm thin c-Si solar cell (after Ref.

The next generation cell would have typical device structure as shown in Fig. 2.20. The back surface passivation would be essential part of the cell and laser ﬁring-based contact (LFC) would be preferable option for back contact formation (Schneiderlochner et al. 2002; Sánchez-Aniorte et al. 2010; Petermann et al. 2012; Wang et al. 2014). Front contact can be screen printed Ag/Al or plated Cu based contacts. The front surface would have light-trapping structure with antireﬂection coating. Advanced light-trapping structure would replace texturing-based light-trapping structure since texturing of surface increases surface recombination which is more crucial when thinner wafer are being aimed. Texturing-based light-trapping struc- tures also consume material and also results in reduction in absorption in active material. Traditional light-trapping structure as well as advanced alternative light-trapping structures favorable for next-generation thin c-Si solar cells has been explored in this book in greater detail in subsequent chapters. 2.8 Questions and Problems 1.

When two monochromatic coherent waves having constant phase difference meet, the interference phenomena is observed. Detailed analysis of interference-based anti-reﬂection and principle behind the observed phenomenon has been covered. Starting from simple reﬂection and interference of the reﬂected light from single dielectric coating, the phenomenon of anti-reﬂection has been covered and extended to multilayer anti-reﬂection coating applications. The thickness and refractive index of a dielectric layers are the two most important parameters of concerns for their use as anti-reﬂection coatings. Correlation with reﬂectance minima with wavelength and dielectric layer parameters has been presented. Experimental measurements of reﬂectance for various suitable anti-reﬂection coatings have also been presented and compared with the theoretical results. At the end, beneﬁts and limitations of dielectric-based reﬂectance have been discussed in context of c-Si solar cells. 3.1 Reﬂection, Refraction, and Transmission from Dielectric Interfaces When light (electromagnetic wave/radiation) incident and interact at the interface of two different dielectric materials having different refractive indices (RIs), phe- nomenon of reﬂection, refraction, and transmission is observed. 3.1.1 Reﬂection, Refraction, and Transmission The phenomenon where some fraction of light is reﬂected is called reﬂection and this fraction is quantized and termed as reﬂection coefﬁcient or reﬂection amplitude.  Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017 C.S. Solanki and H.K. Singh, Anti-reﬂection and Light Trapping in c-Si Solar Cells, Green Energy and Technology, DOI 10.1007/978-981-10-4771-8_3 43 The term reﬂectance (R) is used to represent the proportion of light getting reﬂected back at the interface with respect to incident light/radiation. Further; the phe- nomenon of light deﬂection from its path while entering in other medium from interface is called refraction. The light deﬂection from its path is governed by the refractive index (RI) of the material. The light entering into the medium at interface of two dielectric medium either gets absorbed or transmitted depending upon the absorption coefﬁcient of the material/medium as discussed in Sect. 1.7. The term absorbance (A) is used to represent the proportion of light getting absorbed within the medium with respect to incident light/radiation. Also, the phenomenon where some fraction of light gets through the second medium without getting absorbed within the medium is called transmission and the term transmittance (T) is used to represent the proportion of light getting transmitted through the medium at the interface with respect to incident light/radiation. At any given point and time, the reﬂectance (R), transmittance, (T) and absorbance (A) are related as in Eq. (3.1). R þ A þ T ¼ 1 ð3:1Þ Reﬂection, refraction, and transmission phenomenon at an interface of two different dielectric medium having refractive index n1 and n2 respectively can be seen in Fig. 3.1. The radiation having amplitude ri incident at interface of two different dielectrics at an incident angle hi from normal gets reﬂected at an angle hr from normal with amplitude rr and refracted/transmitted at an angle ht from normal with amplitude rt. The plane which contains the incident ray/radiation and the normal is known as plane of incidence. Experimental observations have shown that the phenomenon of light reﬂection, refraction, and absorption follows certain laws. At an interface of two dielectric medium, the reﬂected radiation (rr) lies in the same plane as incident radiation (ri) and angle of reﬂection is same as angle of incidence, i.e., hi = hr. This is known as law of reﬂection. Also, the refracted/transmitted radiation (rt) from interface lies in the same plane and the Dielectric-1 (n1) Dielectric-2 (n2) ri rr θi θr θt rt normal Fig. 3.1 Schematic of electromagnetic (light) reﬂection, refraction and transmission at an interface between two dielectric medium having refractive index n1 and n2 respectively. Subscript i stands for incident radiation, r for reﬂected radiation and t for refracted or transmitted radiation 44 3 Principle of Dielectric-Based Anti-reﬂection and Light Trapping angle of refraction is related with angle of incidence as per Eq. (3.2). This relation is known as law of refraction or Snells law. n2sinht ¼ n1sinhi ð3:2Þ It indicates that the propagation of light in denser medium (high refractive index) is closer to surface normal. Note that all the laws as mentioned above fall under ray optics, required for understanding of the light propagation, reﬂection, and refrac- tion. However, it does not describe the diffraction, polarization, and interference phenomenon observed when the electromagnetic waves/light interact with each other. These concepts are well treated in wave optics. 3.1.2 Wave Optics Based Interaction of Light with Dielectric Medium and Interfaces Diffraction, polarization, and interference phenomenon which are the key to explain the observed reﬂection, absorption, and transmission accurately through dielectric medium and interfaces are explored under wave optics which follows Huygens principle and describes optical phenomenon based on electromagnetic theory fol- lowing Maxwells Eqs.

At interface of the two dielectric medium, the incident (i), reﬂected (r), and transmitted (t) light would be continuous and would satisfy the following boundary conditions for electric and magnetic ﬁelds as mentioned in Eqs. (3.9) and (3.10). EðiÞðr; tÞ þEðrÞðr; tÞ ¼ EðtÞðr; tÞ ð3:9Þ HðiÞðr; tÞ þ HðrÞðr; tÞ ¼ HðtÞðr; tÞ ð3:10Þ The above two equations are the key to solve the electromagnetic equations for the case when light or any electromagnetic wave interact with matter at any interface having different refractive indices. 3.1.3 Fresnel Equations for Reﬂection and Transmission Fresnel equations are solution of electromagnetic equations for light interaction at interface having different refractive indices. It accounts for the reﬂection and transmission of light from a dielectric interface and is helpful in estimating the faction of light/electromagnetic radiation that would be reﬂected or transmitted from the interface. In derivation of Fresnel equations, it is assumed that the surface/interface is ﬂat and dielectric medium is homogenous. In Fresnel equations, the light is treated as plane wave. The light from sun coming to earth are randomly polarized or unpolarized. However, the mathematical treatment of unpolarized light is complicated. For mathematical analysis, the unpolarized light is assumed as superposition of two polarized waves whose plane of oscillation is perpendicular to each other. Here plane of oscillation is deﬁned as plane containing electric ﬁeld vectors. Figure 3.2a shows the representation of an unpolarized light consisting waves with randomly directed electric ﬁelds. Figure 3.2b shows the representation of unpolarized light in the form of superposition of two polarized waves having plane of oscillation perpendicular to each other. This is to represent the difference in physical behavior of s-polarized and p-polarized light which in combination can be used to represent the unpolarized light. Since, mathematically we can not do cal- culations representing the unpolarized light, the mathematical calculations are done for s-polarized and p-polarized light and results of these calculations are combined to draw conclusion for unpolarized light. Here s-polarized light is deﬁned as the light whose electric ﬁeld vectors are perpendicular to the plane of incidence. The plane of incidence is deﬁned as plane containing the incident, reﬂected, and refracted electromagnetic radiation/ray (yz plane in Fig. 3.3). Also, p-polarized light is deﬁned as the light whose electric ﬁeld vectors are parallel to the plane of incidence. 46 3 Principle of Dielectric-Based Anti-reﬂection and Light Trapping Solving the Maxwell electromagnetic equations with boundary conditions (Eqs. 3.9 and 3.10) gives the Fresnel equations for normalized reﬂected (rr) and transmitted (rt) electromagnetic radiation/light amplitudes for the case p-polarized light and s-polarized light. These equations are given as Eqs. (3.11)(3.14), where the dielectric medium has been assumed to be nonmagnetic which is true for most of the optical materials. rp r ¼ n2 cos hi  n1 cos ht n2 cos hi þ n1 cos ht ð3:11Þ rs r ¼ n1 cos hi  n2 cos ht n1 cos hi þ n2 cos ht ð3:12Þ y z (a) (b) Fig. 3.2 a Unpolarized light consisting waves with randomly oriented electric ﬁelds; b represen- tation of unpolarized light in form of superposition of two polarized waves having plane of oscillation perpendicular to each other Dielectric-1 (n1) Dielectric-2 (n2) ri rr θi θr θt rt Hi Ei normal Dielectric-1 (n1) Dielectric-2 (n2) ri rr θi θr θt rt Ei Hi normal x y z (a) (b) Fig. 3.3 Schematic for incident, reﬂection, refraction plane and light interaction at dielectric interface for the case of a incident electromagnetic wave (light) parallel to the plane of incident (p-polarized light); b incident electromagnetic wave (light) perpendicular to the plane of incident (s-polarized light) 3.1 Reﬂection, Refraction, and Transmission from Dielectric Interfaces 47 rp t ¼ 2n1 cos hi n2 cos hi þ n1 cos ht ð3:13Þ rs t ¼ 2n1 cos hi n1 cos hi þ n2 cos ht ð3:14Þ Here, rr p and rr s represent the normalized amplitudes of the reﬂected light for p-polarized and s-polarized case, respectively. Also, rt p and rt s represent the nor- malized amplitudes of the transmitted/refracted light for p-polarized and s-polarized case, respectively. n1 is the refractive index of the ﬁrst medium and n2 is the refractive index of second medium (see Fig. 3.3). hi and-ht are angle of incidence and refraction respectively from normal. The reﬂectance (R) for the p-polarized and s-polarized light is deﬁned as square of normalized reﬂected (rr) light amplitude. The reﬂectance of the p-polarized light and s-polarized light is given by Eq. (3.15) and Eq. (3.16), respectively. Rp ¼ ðrp r Þ2 ¼ ðn2 cos hi  n1 cos htÞ2 ðn2 cos hi þ n1 cos htÞ2 ð3:15Þ Rs ¼ ðrs rÞ2 ¼ ðn1 cos hi  n2 cos htÞ2 ðn1 cos hi þ n2 cos htÞ2 ð3:16Þ Further, assuming that there is no loss of energy at boundary/interface, the transmittance (T) can be given by Eq. (3.17) and Eq. (3.18) for p-polarized light and s-polarized light, respectively.

(3.19) and Eq. (3.20), respectively. R ¼ Rp þ Rs 2 ð3:19Þ T ¼ Tp þ Ts 2 ð3:20Þ For solar cell application, it is important that the light reaches to active absorbing material, where photovoltaic effect takes place and hence the reﬂection from surface 48 3 Principle of Dielectric-Based Anti-reﬂection and Light Trapping should be minimum. In c-Si solar cell, reﬂection from airSi interface is obvious as there is dielectric medium change where refractive index (RI) changes. The reﬂectance from interface for different wavelengths would be different as the refractive index of a material is wavelength dependent parameter. The reﬂection form airSi interface can be minimized for selected wavelengths by introducing dielectric thin ﬁlm layer at interface as discussed in next section. 3.2 Dielectric Thin Films and Their Role in Reﬂection Reduction As discussed above when light falls on any interface of two different dielectrics, the phenomenon of reﬂection, refraction, and transmission is observed. In solar cell operation, there is need to minimize the reﬂection from the surface to allow maxi- mum light to travel into the active absorber material and get absorbed. The reﬂection can be engineered by introducing a thin dielectric ﬁlm at the top of absorber layer. Depending upon the thickness and refractive index of the introduced thin dielectric ﬁlm, the reﬂection from surface can be tuned. The dielectric layer with refractive index n2 introduced between two dielectric layers with refractive indices n1 and n3 results in creating another interface affecting the incident light as shown in Fig. 3.4a. The incident radiation/light now gets reﬂected from interface of dielectrics with RIs n1 and n2 as well as at interface of dielectrics with RIs n2 and n3. In such case, the interference occurs between the rays reﬂected from the two interfaces. Depending upon the phase difference between the two reﬂected rays (ray or wave amplitudes r12 and r23), constructive or destructive interference occur Dielectric-1 (n1) Dielectric-3 (n3) ri r12 θi θr rt Dielectric-2 (n2) r23 normal Air (n1=1) Dielectric (n2) Semiconductor (Si) (n3=3.8) r12 r23 ri d θ θ (a) (b) Fig. 3.4 Schematic for reﬂection, refraction of incident rays at thin dielectric ﬁlm with refractive index n2 introduced at interface of two dielectric medium with refractive indices n1 and n3, respectively; b dielectric ﬁlm with thickness d and refractive index n2 introduced at interface air (refractive indices n1 = 1) and Si (refractive indices n3 = 3.8) respectively 3.1 Reﬂection, Refraction, and Transmission from Dielectric Interfaces 49 which leads to high or low reﬂection from the interface. The phase difference (D/) between the two reﬂected rays (r12 and r23) is related with the path difference between the two rays (which is approximately equal to the double of the thin dielectric ﬁlm thickness) as given in Eq. (3.21): D/ ¼ 2pn k  2d; ð3:21Þ where n is refractive index of medium in which path difference occur, k is wave- length of light, and d is the thickness of the dielectric thin ﬁlm. Hence, the phase difference between the two reﬂectance rays through the thin dielectric medium would be D/ ¼ 2pn2 k  2d ð3:22Þ The reﬂected rays would result in high resultant reﬂection from the interface for wavelength k if the total phase difference is 0, 2p, 4p, 6p, etc., i.e., even multiple of p. It would result in a resultant reﬂection minimum if the total phase difference is 0, p, 3p, 5p, etc., i.e., odd multiple of p. Now to count the total phase difference, it is important to know that whenever light incident at interface from lighter dielectric medium (low refractive index) to denser dielectric medium (high refractive index), there would be always a phase change of p. However, no phase change occurs during refraction and for the case of light incident at interface from denser medium to lighter dielectric medium. The sum of interface-based phase shift and the phase shift introduced by path difference due to dielectric thin ﬁlm gives total phase difference between the reﬂected rays. It means if n2  n1 and n2  n3(see Fig. 3.4a), the path difference between the two rays (2d) with (m+1/2) k n2 ; where m is a whole number (m = 0, 1, 2, 3) would result in high resultant reﬂection from the interface for wavelength k as it would make total phase difference an even multiple of p since r12 would see a phase shift of p at dielectric-1dielectric-2 interface (n2  n1) and no phase shift for r23 at dielectric-2dielectric-3 (n2 n3) interface (n2  n3). Also, a resultant reﬂection minimum would be observed if the path difference between the two rays (2d) is (m) k n2 which would make total phase dif- ference an odd multiple of p. Here also by solving Maxwell electromagnetic equations with appropriate boundary conditions, Fresnel equations for normalized reﬂected (rr) and transmitted (rt) electromagnetic radiation amplitudes for the case p-polarized light and s-polarized light can be obtained which can be used to calculate the reﬂectance from the interface as discussed in above section. The Fresnel equation based reﬂectance in such case is given by Eq. (3.23): 50 3 Principle of Dielectric-Based Anti-reﬂection and Light Trapping R ¼ r2 12 þ r2 23 þ 2r12r23cosðD/Þ 1 þ r12r23 þ 2r12r23cosðD/Þ ; ð3:23Þ where r12 is the reﬂection amplitude between dielectric-1 to dielectric-2 interface and r23 is the reﬂection amplitude between dielectric-2 and dielectric-3 interface (see Fig. 3.4a) and this Eq. (3.23) is true for both p-polarized and s-polarized light independently which can be calculated similar to Eqs. (3.11)(3.20). D/ is phase difference between rays r12 and r23 calculated as per Eq. (3.22). Experimentally measured total reﬂectance from c-Si wafer and c-Si wafer coated with dielectric anti-reﬂection layer (75 nm thick silicon nitride (SiNx)) for near normal incident light is shown in Fig. 3.5. Notice that the reﬂection for c-Si is much higher than the c-Si coated with silicon nitride dielectric layer. Also, for the case of dielectric coated layer there is a clear reﬂection minima seen at around 580 590 nm. This position of reﬂection minima at around 570580 nm is due to fact that the condition destructive interference gets satisﬁed for these wavelengths. Wavelength for which the reﬂection minima would occur is given by Eq. (3.24): D/ ¼ 2pn2 k  2d ¼ 2pðm þ 1 2Þ; ð3:24Þ where m is whole number (m = 0, 1, 2, 3). Here odd multiple of p is taken as refractive index of air (n1 = 1) is less than the dielectric thin ﬁlm refractive index (SiNx; n2 = 1.95); and refractive index of c-Si substrate (n3 = 3.8) is greater than the dielectric thin ﬁlm refractive index (SiNx; n2 = 1.95) (n2  n1 and n3  n2; see Fig. 3.4b). So to keep the total phase difference an odd multiple of p for reﬂection minima, the phase difference introduced by path length reference with the help of thin SiNx dielectric ﬁlm should be odd multiple of p as light incident at interface from lighter dielectric medium (low refractive index) to denser dielectric medium (high refractive index) at interface and both rays undergo an interface-based phase change of p. So here total 2p interface-based phase change which is different from the case as discussed above for case of n2  n1 and n2  n3, where total Fig. 3.5 Measured total reﬂectance from a c-Si wafer and a c-Si wafer coated with 80 nm silicon nitride (SiNx) dielectric layer for near normal incident light 3.2 Dielectric Thin Films and Their Role in Reﬂection Reduction 51 interface-based phase change is only p. So considering m = 0 in Eq. (3.24), the equation is modiﬁes as: 2pn2 kmin  2d ¼ p ð3:25Þ Therefore, wavelength at which the reﬂection minima would occur would be given by following equation kmin ¼ 4d:n2 ð3:26Þ In this case, n2 is 1.95 and d = 75 nm and hence kmin would theoretically be at around 585, which is also observed at similar wavelength range in experimentally measured data presented in Fig. 3.5. 3.3 Role of Refractive Index and Dielectric Medium As discussed in above Sects. 3.1 and 3.2, when light falls on an interface of two dielectric materials of different refractive indices, reﬂection, refraction, and trans- mission would occur. The faction of light which would be reﬂected or transmitted at the interface is governed by the refractive index of the material or medium. Refractive index (also known as index of refraction) of a material/medium is expressed as the ratio of speed of light in vacuum (c) to the phase velocity of light in material/medium (v) as given in Eq. (3.27) and indicates the bending of light when it passes from one medium to other. n ¼ c v ð3:27Þ If refractive index of a material is 2, it indicates that the light travels two times slower in the material/medium compared to in vacuum. This speed difference comes from the bending of light from its original path during refraction. Refractive index of a material/medium is different for different wavelengths and is also a characteristic of a material or medium. For better light anti-reﬂection in solar cells, it is necessary to choose suitable dielectric material so that the reﬂection can be minimized from the interface. There are many dielectrics, e.g., silicon dioxide (SiO2), silicon nitride (SiNx), titanium oxide (TiO2), aluminum oxide (Al2O3), magnesium ﬂuoride (MgF2), amorphous silicon (a-Si), silicon carbide (SiC), etc., which can be used as anti-reﬂection coating. The refractive index plot for some dielectric materials mostly used for anti-reﬂection effect in c-Si solar cells is shown in Fig. 3.6 for 3001200 nm wavelength range. Let us evaluate the impact of refractive index on reﬂection from interface of two dielectrics and for the case where the interface is coated with thin dielectric thin ﬁlm for anti-reﬂection effect. For simplicity of calculations and understanding, assume 52 3 Principle of Dielectric-Based Anti-reﬂection and Light Trapping that the normal incident of light at the interface, that means the ray incident at the interface at an angle hi ¼ 0o(ri in Fig. 3.3 and Fig. 3.4). Case I: Consider the case of two dielectrics (dielectric-1 and dielectric-2) interface as shown in Fig. 3.3, where light falls from dielectric-1 and goes through interface to dielectric-2. For the case of normal incidence of light, hi would be 0. And from Snells law of refraction as given in Eq. (3.2), cos(ht) would be given by Eq. (3.28): cos ht ¼ ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ 1  ðn1 n2 Þ2Sin2hi r ð3:28Þ which results in cos(ht) = 1; and the reﬂectance and transmittance Eqs. (3.19) (3.20) would be transformed into following form: R ¼ ðn1  n2Þ2 ðn1 þ n2Þ2 ð3:29Þ T ¼ 1  R ¼ 4n1n2 ðn1 þ n2Þ2 ð3:30Þ It is clear from Eq. (3.29) that the reﬂection would be minimum if the refractive index is same of both dielectrics. However, in c-Si solar cells, light comes from air (refractive index*1) and falls on airSi interface. The reﬂectance from Si surface for light of wavelength 680 nm (refractive index*3.8 at 680 nm) in such case would be around 3436% which is really high and would require minimization. Case II: In case II, let us consider the case of two dielectrics (dielectric-1 and dielectric-2) interface where interface is coated with thin dielectric thin ﬁlm for anti-reﬂection effect as shown in Fig. 3.4. Here again for the case of normal inci- dence of light, hi would be 0o and cos(ht) = 1 as discussed above. The reﬂectance in this case would be resultant of R12, i.e., the reﬂectance between dielectric-1 to Fig. 3.6 Wavelength dependent refractive index for Silicon nitride (SiNx) (Duttagupta et al. 2012), Silicon oxide (SiOx) (McIntosh et al. 2014), Titanium oxide (TiO2) (Richards 2003), Aluminum oxide (Al2O3) (Kumar et al. 2009), and magnesium ﬂuoride (MgF2) (Siqueiros et al. 1988) 3.3 Role of Refractive Index and Dielectric Medium 53 dielectric-2 interface and R23, i.e., the reﬂectance between dielectric-2 to dielectric-3 interface (see Fig. 3.4a) as discussed in Sect. 3.2. Here since there are three dielectrics are involved, two more cases can arise: Situation (II-a): n1  n2  n3 or n1  n2  n3 In such situation, interface-based phase shift would be same at both dielectric interface n1 n2 and n2 n3 (see Fig. 3.4a) and minimum reﬂection would be observed for path difference based phase shift D/ ¼ 2pn2 k  2d ¼ 2pðm þ 1 2Þ(where m = 0, 1, 2, 3) which means if cos(D/) = 1, the Eq. (3.23) can be rewritten for minimum reﬂection as: Rmin ¼ r2 12 þ r2 23  2r12r23 1 þ r12r23  2r12r23 ¼ ðr12  r23Þ2 ð1  r12r23Þ2 ð3:31Þ For the case of normal incidence of light, hi would be 0o and cos(ht) at second interface would also be 1. And the minimum reﬂection equation would be as follows: Rmin ¼ ðn1n3  n2 2 n1n3 þ n2 2 Þ2 ð3:32Þ Equation (3.32) indicates that to have minimum reﬂection (zero or nearly zero) using dielectric thin ﬁlm coating, the refractive index of the thin ﬁlm dielectric should be square root of the top and bottom dielectrics. n2 ¼ ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ n1n3 p ð3:33Þ For Si substrate (see Fig. 3.4b), the thin dielectric coating refractive index (n2) should be around 1.92 for minimum reﬂection in visible wavelength range. Dielectric layers like SiNx and TiO2 are the promising candidates for anti-reﬂection coating. Situation (II-b): n1  n2  n3 or n1  n2  n3 In such situation, interface-based phase shift would be introduced at only one dielectric interface n1 n2 or n2 n3 (see Fig. 3.4a), where the light enters from low refractive index medium to high refractive index medium. And minimum reﬂection would be observed for path difference based phase shift D/ ¼ 2pn2 k  2d ¼ 2pm (where m = 0, 1, 2, 3), i.e., if cos(D/) = 1. Therefore, the Eq. (3.23) can be rewritten for minimum reﬂection as: Rmin ¼ r2 12 þ r2 23 þ 2r12r23 1 þ r12r23 þ 2r12r23 ¼ ðr12 þ r23Þ2 ð1 þ r12r23Þ2 54 3 Principle of Dielectric-Based Anti-reﬂection and Light Trapping Again here, for the case of normal incidence of light, hi would be 0o and cos(ht) = 1. And the equation for minimum reﬂection would be as follows: Rmin ¼ ðn1  n3 n1 þ n3 Þ2 ð3:32Þ This situation indicates that there is no role of thin dielectric ﬁlm (n2) in reﬂection minimization when intermediate dielectric ﬁlm refractive index is either higher or lower than both top and bottom dielectrics (n1  n2  n3 or n1  n2  n3). This analysis suggests that minimum reﬂection using dielectric thin ﬁlm coating can be achieved only when the dielectrics are arranged in graded manner either in decreasing or increasing order of refractive indices (n1  n2  n3 or n1  n2  n3). 3.4 Multilayer Dielectric Thin Films for Reﬂection Reduction We have seen the role of a thin dielectric ﬁlm at the interface of two dielectric medium as how it can be utilized to reduce reﬂection from surface. Also, it is explained in the previous section that to get minimum reﬂection from interface using anti-reﬂection coating, the refractive index should be either in increasing or decreasing order. The suitable design is obtained when the dielectric material refractive index is in decreasing order from top to bottom. It is observed that using single-layer dielectric layer reﬂection from the surface can be minimized only at one particular wavelength. However for c-Si solar cells, it is desirable to minimize the reﬂection across the useful wavelength range of solar spectrum ranging from 300 to 1200 nm. By using multiple dielectric ﬁlms as anti-reﬂection coatings, one can achieve multiple reﬂection minima from the sur- face which results in overall reduction in reﬂection. A multilayer thin dielectric ﬁlm coated system can be seen in Fig. 3.7a. The condition for better anti-reﬂection from multiple dielectric ﬁlms would be same as that of single ﬁlm, i.e., the refractive indices of the thin dielectric coatings on interface should be in increasing order from top to bottom. In multilayer anti-reﬂection coating, the reﬂection and transmission from each interface is important and governs the resultant reﬂection from the entire device/system. The Snells law for refraction/reﬂection angle in the multilayer system is expressed as follows (see Fig. 3.7a): nisinhi ¼ n2sinh2 ¼ npsinhp ¼ nm þ 1sinht p ¼ 1; 2; 3; 4. . .m þ 1 ð Þ ð3:33Þ The use of multilayer thin ﬁlm coatings for reﬂection reduction should not result in increased cost, which is always an important constraints in solar cell applications. Invariable due to addition processing cost, as the number of anti-reﬂection ﬁlms increases the cost also increases. As a result, at most, two layers or double-layer 3.3 Role of Refractive Index and Dielectric Medium 55 anti-reﬂection coatings are used in c-Si solar cells. Figure 3.7b shows a device schematic where two thin dielectric ﬁlms has been introduced between the dielectric-1 and dielectric-4. In double-layer anti-reﬂection geometry, the Snells law for refraction/reﬂection angle can be given as per Eq. (3.34): n1sinhi ¼ n2sinh2 ¼ n3sinh3 ¼ n4sinht ð3:34Þ So; sinht ¼ n1 n4 sinhi ð3:35Þ Solving Maxwell electromagnetic equations with appropriate boundary condi- tions, Fresnel equations for normalized reﬂected (rr) and transmitted (rt) electro- magnetic radiation amplitudes for the case p-polarized light and s-polarized light can be obtained which can be used to calculate the reﬂectance from the interface as discussed in Sect. 3.1. For multilayer anti-reﬂection coating, the Fresnel equation derivation is much more complex and is not being discussed here. The Fresnel equation for reﬂectance from double-layer anti-reﬂection coating as shown in Fig. 3.7b can be given by Eq. (3.36): R ¼ A þ B þ C þ D þ E F þ G þ H þ I þ J ð3:36Þ Dielectric-1 (n1) Dielectric-4 (n4) ri r12 θi θr Dielectric-2 (n2) r23 Dielectric-3 (n3) r34 (b) normal θ2 θ3 θt (a) Dielectric-1 (n1) Dielectric-m+1 (nm+1) ri r12 θi θr rt,m+1 Dielectric-2 (n2) r23 Dielectric-3 (n3) r34 Dielectric-p (np) Dielectric-m (nm) Θt θm θ2 θ3 rpm rt Fig. 3.7 Schematic of a a multilayer thin dielectric ﬁlm coated interface of dielectric-1 and dielectric-(m+1); b double-layer thin dielectric ﬁlm coated interface of dielectric-1 and dielectric-(4) 56 3 Principle of Dielectric-Based Anti-reﬂection and Light Trapping Here, A ¼ r2 12 þ r2 23 þ r2 34 þ r2 12r2 23r2 34 B ¼ 2r12r23ð1 þ r2 34ÞcosðD/1223Þ C ¼ 2r23r34ð1 þ r2 12ÞcosðD/2334Þ D ¼ 2r12r34cosðD/1223 þ D/2334Þ E ¼ 2r12r2 23r34cosðD/1223  D/2334Þ F ¼ 1 þ r2 12r2 23 þ r2 12r2 34 þ r2 23r2 34 G ¼ 2r12r23ð1 þ r2 34ÞcosðD/1223Þ H ¼ 2r23r34ð1 þ r2 12ÞcosðD/2334Þ I ¼ 2r12r23cosðD/1223 þ D/2334Þ J ¼ 2r12r2 23r34cosðD/1223  D/2334Þ; where r12 is the reﬂection amplitude between dielectric-1 to dielectric-2 interface, r23 is the reﬂection between dielectric-2 to dielectric-3 interface and r34 is the reﬂection between dielectric-3 to dielectric-4 interface (see Fig. 3.7b) and the Eq. (3.36) is true for both p-polarized and s-polarized light independently which can be calculated as per Eqs. (3.15), (3.16), and (3.19). The D/1223 is phase difference between rays r12 and r23and D/2334 is phase difference between rays r23 and r34 calculated as per Eqs. (3.37) and (3.38): D/1223 ¼ 2pn2 k  2d2 ð3:37Þ D/2334 ¼ 2pn3 k  2d3; ð3:38Þ where d2 and d3 is the thickness of thin dielectric ﬁlms dielectric-2 and dielectric-3 respectively.It is clear from Eqs. (3.36), (3.37) and (3.38) that for better opti- mization of reﬂection from a double-layer anti-reﬂection coating, thickness of the two dielectric thin ﬁlms and their refractive indices would play a crucial role. Assuming the graded index pattern where n1  n2  n3  n4 (see Fig. 3.7a), the minimum reﬂectance would be observed for path difference based phase shift D/1223 ¼ 2pn2 k  2d2 ¼ 2pðm þ 1 2Þ and D/2334 ¼ 2pn3 k  2d3 ¼ 2pðm þ 1 2Þ (where m = 0, 1, 2, 3) which means if cos(D/1223) and cos(D/2334) is equal to 1, the interface-based phase shift would be same at all the dielectric interface n1 n2, n2 n3 and n3 n4(see Fig. 3.7b) as the light travels from lighter to denser med- ium. In such case, cosðD/1223 þ D/2334Þ = 1 and cosðD/1223  D/2334Þ = 1 and the Eq. (3.36) can be rewritten for minimum reﬂection as: 3.4 Multilayer Dielectric Thin Films for Reﬂection Reduction 57 Rmin ¼ r2 12 þ r2 23 þ r2 34 þ r2 12r2 23r2 34  2r12r23ð1 þ r2 34Þ  2r23r34ð1 þ r2 12Þ þ 2r12r34 þ 2r12r2 23r34 1 þ r2 12r2 23 þ r2 12r2 34 þ r2 23r2 34  2r12r23ð1 þ r2 34Þ  2r23r34ð1 þ r2 12Þ þ 2r12r23 þ 2r12r2 23r34 ð3:39Þ Equation (3.39) is true for both p-polarized and s-polarized light independently which can be calculated similar to Eqs. (3.11)(3.20). For better anti-reﬂection using double anti-reﬂection coating, thickness of coatings and refractive index require proper optimization. The dielectric material and its thickness as an effective anti-reﬂection coating is decided by targeted wavelength range, where we want to minimize reﬂection. For c-Si solar cells, the wavelengths of our interest are 300 1200 nm, where we would need broadband anti-reﬂection effect for this whole wavelength range. Open source softwares like OPAL2 (PVlighthouse; Mcintosh and Baker-ﬁnch 2012) and PC1D (PC1D 5.9) can be used for calculations and for better understanding for reﬂectance proﬁle from multilayer dielectric thin ﬁlms. In c-Si-based solar cells for double anti-reﬂection coating (DLARC) based reﬂection minimization, mostly SiOx and SiNx dielectric or TiO2 and MgF2dielectric combination is used. In Fig. 3.8a, an example of simulated reﬂec- tance from Si substrate using 80 nm thin magnesium ﬂuoride (MgF2), 80 nm thin silicon nitride (SiNx) and SiNx (60 nm)-MgF2 (40 nm) optimum combination is shown. Impact of DLARC over single-layer anti-reﬂection coating (ARC) and role of refractive index material on reﬂection reduction can be noticed. For single-layer ARC, silicon nitride (SiNx) with refractive index about 2 is better choice than magnesium ﬂuoride (MgF2) with refractive index about 1.3 as it leads to relatively better anti-reﬂection effect as shown in Fig. 3.8a. Also, further improvement in anti-reﬂectance is expected for certain wavelengths when optimum combination of SiNx (60 nm)-MgF2 (40 nm) DLARC is used. For example, relatively better anti-reﬂection below 550 nm can be seen in Fig. 3.8a with combination of SiNx (60 nm)-MgF2 (40 nm) DLARC compared to 80 nm SiNx ARC. Fig. 3.8 Simulated reﬂectance from a Si substrate using 80 nm thin magnesium ﬂuoride (MgF2), 80 nm thin silicon nitride (SiNx) and SiNx (60 nm)-MgF2 (40 nm) optimum combination; b Si substrate using 80 nm thin titanium oxide (TiO2), 100 nm thin magnesium ﬂuoride (MgF2) and TiO2 (80 nm)-MgF2 (100 nm) optimum combination 58 3 Principle of Dielectric-Based Anti-reﬂection and Light Trapping Similarly, in Fig. 3.8b, an example of simulated reﬂectance from Si substrate using 80 nm thin titanium oxide (TiO2), 100 nm thin magnesium ﬂuoride (MgF2), and TiO2 (80 nm)-MgF2 (100 nm) optimum combination is shown. Here again, impact of DLARC over single-layer anti-reﬂection coating (ARC) and role of refractive index material on reﬂection reduction can be noticed. Improvement in anti-reﬂectance for certain wavelengths is as expected when optimum combination of TiO2 (80 nm)-MgF2 (100 nm) DLARC is used. For example, relatively better anti-reﬂection below 500 nm and above 800 nm can be seen in Fig. 3.8b with combination of TiO2 (80 nm)-MgF2 (100 nm) DLARC compared to 80 nm TiO2 ARC. Also, for combination of TiO2 (80 nm)-MgF2 (100 nm) DLARC, two reﬂection minima can be noticed at around 450 nm and 900 nm instead of single minima at around 600 nm as for 80 nm TiO2. This is due to the condition met for destructive interference of light reﬂected from the dielectric interfaces at two dif- ferent wavelengths in 3001200 nm wavelength range. As discussed in Sect. 3.3 for reﬂection minimum, it is required that the phase shift (D/ ¼ 2pn2 k  2d) be integral multiple of p. For different combination of dielectric ﬁlm thicknesses and refractive indices, reﬂection minima can be achieved for two or more wavelengths in 3001200 nm wavelength range. 3.5 Additional Functionality of Dielectric Anti-reﬂection Layers As discussed in above sections for reﬂection minimization using dielectric thin ﬁlms, refractive index and thickness of dielectric thin ﬁlm should be optimized such that it would be in accordance with targeted wavelength range for which the reﬂection is to be minimized. However, the suitability of dielectric material is not only decided by its reﬂection minimization property. In c-Si solar cells, these dielectric thin ﬁlms also serves the purpose of surface passivation and this should be also taken care of while choosing the dielectric material. c-Si surface sees abrupt discontinuity of crystal structure which leads to unsat- urated valance bonds of Si atoms in the crystal, also known as dangling bonds (see Fig. 3.9a). These dangling bonds act as recombination center and reduce the minority carrier life time in the Si material (Goetzberger et al. 1998; Aberle 2001; Rahman 2012; Choi et al. 2012). To avoid such recombination at surface, surface passivation is done either by chemical passivation or by ﬁeld passivation methods. In chemical passivation, thin dielectric ﬁlms helps to passivate the dangling bonds present at c-Si surface and result in reduction of interface defects which would had acted as recombination center instead. In ﬁeld passivation method, the concentra- tion of electron or hole is signiﬁcantly reduced at the surface/interface by means of built in electric ﬁeld. The recombination process happens when both electron and 3.4 Multilayer Dielectric Thin Films for Reﬂection Reduction 59 holes are present and recombination at interface would be maximum when electron and holes are available in equal magnitude (Rahman and Khan 2012). The mag- nitude of electrons or holes at interface can be altered by means of providing electrostatic ﬁeld at interface which repels a particular type of charge carrier (electron/hole). This is done either by engineering the doping proﬁle below the interface or by ﬁxed insulator charges at the interface. The term surface recom- bination velocity (SRV) is used to quantify the passivation quality. The surface recombination velocity indicates the rate of recombination between electron and hole at surface/interface. For well-passivated surface, the SRV should be as low as possible within cost constraints. A dielectric thin ﬁlms would act as good passi- vation layer if it suitably passivates the dangling bonds chemically at Si surface and also provide sufﬁcient ﬁxed insulator charges (see Fig. 3.9b). Now, it should be clear that how the passivation ability of a particular dielectric thin ﬁlm is also crucial apart from the refractive index and appropriate thickness of the dielectric thin ﬁlm used as anti-reﬂector. In p-type c-Si solar cells, mostly SiNx- based dielectric thin ﬁlm is used as anti-reﬂector which also offers better passivation of emitter due to ﬁxed positive insulator charges at SiNx/Si interface (Aberle 2001). In n-type c-Si solar cells, mostly Al2O3-based dielectric thin ﬁlm is used as anti-reﬂector which also offers better passivation of emitter due to ﬁxed negative insulator charges (in the range of 10121013/cm2) at Al2O3/Si interface (Rahman and Khan 2012). In some high-efﬁciency solar cells, double-layer anti-reﬂector is used such as stack of SiNx/SiO2, SiNx/Al2O3, TiOx/SiNx-, TiOx/Al2O3 (Aberle 2001; Rahman and Khan 2012; Davis et al. 2015) which offers better surface passivation along with desired anti-reﬂection property.

Additionally the dielectric layer also has to play the role of surface passivation. The minimization of reﬂection for broad wavelength range (3001200 nm) using interference-based technique, as presented in this chapter, has its own limitations. It has been seen in Eq. 3.26, for a given thickness and refractive index the reﬂection can be minimized but only for certain wavelengths. The same is demonstrated in Fig. 3.10b for measured reﬂec- tance from a Si substrate coated with SiNx dielectric thin ﬁlm of different thickness and refractive index in the range of 1.921.96. As the thickness of SiNx dielectric thin ﬁlm increases, the reﬂection is reduced and a reﬂection minima is seen for particular wavelength, where condition of phase shift for destructive interference, between incident and reﬂected light, is met as discussed in Sect. 3.3. More than one minima can be seen when increasing the dielectric thin ﬁlm/anti-reﬂector layer thickness as for 160 nm SiNx ﬁlm coated substrate in Fig. 3.10b. This is due to reﬂection minima condition met for different combination of dielectric ﬁlm thicknesses and refractive indices in 3001200 nm wavelength range as discussed in above Sect. 3.4. However, increasing thickness does not result in broadband reﬂection minimization though signiﬁcant reﬂection reduction is achieved for certain wavelengths of light as already seen from Eq. (3.26) as discussed in Sect. 3.2. A technical term weighted reﬂectance (WR) is used to quantify and compare the reﬂectance from various samples. Weighted reﬂectance is weighted average of reﬂectance weighted with incident radiation falling on earth surface in SiNx Si (a) (b) Fig. 3.10 a Schematic of a c-Si substrate coated with silicon nitride (SiNx) thin ﬁlm; b measured total reﬂectance from c-Si substrate and substrates coated with SiNx of different thickness (40, 60, 80 and 160 nm) 3.6 Limitation of Dielectric-Based Anti-reﬂection Structure 61 AM 1.5G condition. The calculation of weighted reﬂectance can be done using Eq. (3.40) (Singh et al. 2016). WR ¼ P k2 k1 ðRTotalðkÞ  I1:5GðkÞÞdk P k I1:5GðkÞdk % ð3:40Þ In Eq. (3.40), Rtotal(k) represents the measured total reﬂectance from the sample for wavelength k; I1.5G(k) represents the spectral irradiance in W/m2/nm for AM 1.5G at wavelength k as per IEC 60904-3 (Standard IEC 60904-3 2008). The dk is wavelength interval for sampled data used for calculation which can be 1 nm or 5 nm as per availability of the data. k1k2 is the wavelength range for which WR is to be calculated. For c-Si-based solar cell, k1 is usually 300 nm and k2 is 1200 nm. It should be noted that the total reﬂectance accounts for reﬂectance from surface, not only in particular direction obeying Snells law but also all other directions too. For smooth ﬂat surface, the total reﬂectance is generally equal to specular reﬂec- tance which follows the Snells law. However, if there is any roughness which may lead to scattering of light, total reﬂectance from surface becomes important. Following Eq. (3.40), the weighted reﬂectance calculated from reﬂectances of the samples, shown in Fig. 3.10b, has been given in Table 3.1. The data indicated that WR for Si is about 38.5% and is brought down to 13.8% using 80 nm SiNx anti-reﬂection layer. Working on refractive index and thickness of SiNx anti-reﬂection layer, the weighted reﬂectance can be brought down to 1213% but still it is signiﬁcant and should be further minimized. For doing this, other approaches are used and many other are being explored. One approach is to randomized light and enhances the light trapping in silicon solar cells further using surface texturization. More details of surface texturization based light trapping technology has been covered in next chapter.

Starting from impact of surface morphology on light trapping, detailed analysis and principle behind the observed phenomenon from textured surfaces has been discussed. For any real solar cell application, the decision for choosing the light trapping structure depends on its cost effectiveness and potential for generating higher current from the solar cells under given solar spectrum. Analytical analysis on current generation potential based on optical path length enhancement capability for different light trapping structures appropriate for c-Si solar cells has been covered. Also, light trapping structures for both mono as well as multi c-Si wafer based cells has been discussed along with, beneﬁts and limi- tations of different surface morphology based light trapping structures. 4.1 Surface Morphology and Its Impact on Light Reﬂection, Refraction and Transmission As we have seen in previous chapter, when the light incident on any planer surface, the phenomenon of reﬂection, refraction and transmission occurs. In planer surface, the reﬂected light lies in the same plane as incident light and angle of reﬂection is same as angle of incidence, i.e., hi = hr as per law of reﬂection. The refracted/ transmitted light from interface lies in the same plane and the angle of refraction is related with angle of incidence, as per Eq. (3.2) which is known as law of refraction. A typical schematic light reﬂection, refraction and transmission can be seen in Fig. 4.1a for planer surface case of an absorbing material. When the surface is rough, light interaction on materials surface gets changed. The reﬂected light is not observed in the same plane and the angle of incident light and the angle of reﬂection is not necessarily in the same as the angle of incidence, i.e., hi 6¼ hr. Note that the laws of reﬂection and refraction are always valid for given  Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017 C.S. Solanki and H.K. Singh, Anti-reﬂection and Light Trapping in c-Si Solar Cells, Green Energy and Technology, DOI 10.1007/978-981-10-4771-8_4 65 point and time, however, in rough surface case, the surface orientation changes at the adjacent points and light go through multiple interaction at rough surface before it is observed to the observer as reﬂected light. As a result, the ﬁnal observed angle of reﬂection is different from angle of incidence in most of the cases (see Fig. 4.1b). When parallel rays of light falls on planer/smooth surface, reﬂected light rays are observed as per law of reﬂection where angle of reﬂection is same as angle of incidence. Such reﬂection phenomenon is known as specular reﬂection as shown in Fig. 4.2a. In such case specular reﬂectance is measured by placing the detector at an angle same as angle of incidence to quantify the reﬂection phenomenon. However, when similar parallel rays of light falls on rough surface, reﬂection in random direction is observed. In such case the observed angle of reﬂection is not same as angle of incidence. Such reﬂection is known as diffused reﬂection (see Fig. 4.2b) and the term diffused reﬂectance is used to quantify the reﬂection phenomenon. For solar cells, the total reﬂectance (specular + diffused) is to be minimized. Hence to characterize the reﬂection from surface, total reﬂectance is measured using integrating sphere where light reﬂected in all directions are collected and measured by the detector. Roughening of the surface not only randomize the angle of reﬂection, it also impact the angle of refraction and results in optical path enhancement of light as light travel longer distance in absorbing material (see Fig. 4.1b).The reﬂection from Absorbing material t normal Өi Өr Өt Absorbing material t normal Өi Өr (a) (b) Fig. 4.1 Schematic of light reﬂection, refraction and transmission on a planer surface (hi = hr); b rough surface (hi 6¼ hr) Absorbing material/Si t (a) Specular ReﬂecƟon t Absorbing material/Si (b) Diﬀused ReﬂecƟon Fig. 4.2 Schematic for reﬂection of parallel rays of light from a planer surface; b rough surface 66 4 Principle of Texturization for Enhanced Light Trapping rough surface which randomize the incident light into random direction is also known as Lambertian reﬂection. Surface roughening helps in tuning the angle of incidence and achieving the required condition leading to total internal reﬂection. By understanding the total internal reﬂection and role of angle of incidence tuning with the help of surface roughening, the reason for enhanced optical path and light trapping in rough surface based absorbing material can be understood. The total internal reﬂection is observed when light incident on any interface from denser medium (higher refractive index) to less denser medium (lesser refractive index) at angle larger than critical angle (hc). The critical angle (hc) is deﬁned by Snells law using the condition where light is reﬂected in same medium, i.e., when ht is 90oor greater. For the case of absorbing material (refractive index: n) to air (refractive index: 1) interface as shown in Fig. 4.3a, the Snells law would be written as per Eq. (4.1) and therefore the critical angle (hc) would be given by Eq. (4.2). nsinhc ¼ sinð90Þ ð4:1Þ hc ¼ sin1ð1 nÞ ð4:2Þ Any light falling on absorbing material-air interface after internal reﬂection would escape from surface if the incident angle is less than the critical angle (hc) as ray-1 shown in Fig. 4.3a. If light incident at angle larger than the critical angle (hc), the phenomenon of total internal reﬂection would occur and light again return in the same absorbing material/medium as ray-2 shown in Fig. 4.3a. In such case, light stays in the same medium and would travel at least one more time in the absorbing material and hence optical path length enhancement is observed. The light would escape from absorbing materials only if it falls on front interface after internal reﬂection from the bottom surface within an angle of hc. Such light escape would be addition to the primary reﬂection from front surface and can be noticed in reﬂec- tance measurements. For c-Si absorbing materials, n is in the range of 3.53.8 for wavelength range of 3001200 nm and hence Ѳc is in the range of 15o17o. 4 2 1 t L L Incident Light Өc (a) normal Өc Ө 3 2 1 Si as absorber (b) Escape cone Fig. 4.3 a Schematic of (a) internal reﬂection of light within absorbing material/medium and representation of critical angle; b trapping of light by Si textured surface which have random pyramids on surface 4.1 Surface Morphology and Its Impact  67 Escape cone term is used to deﬁne the front escape, i.e., the light escape from front surface which adds up with the reﬂectance from front surface as discussed above. This escape cone is three dimension which accounts for light escape from front surface not only in particular direction, but from all direction at any angle within the cone. The fraction of light which would escape is the fraction of light within the escape cone (fesc). Assuming the transmissivity at top surface as 100% and rear surface as perfect reﬂector (R = 1 or 100%), fesc would be give by Eq. (4.3) (in spherical coordinates). fesc ¼ R hc 0 R 2p 0 cos hsinhdhd/ R p=2 0 R 2p 0 cos hsinhdhd/ ¼ 1  cos2hc 2 ¼ 1 n2 ð4:3Þ where hc is critical angle. It indicates the dependence of front escape on refractive index of the absorbing material. Further, in case of Lambertian light trapping geometry, the average path length of light across the absorbing material between front and rear surface is at least twice of the absorbing material thickness (t) due to oblique propagation of light (Campbell and Green 1987). The mean path length of weekly absorbed light for Lambertian top surface and reﬂective rear surface (with reﬂectance R) can be calculated by tracking the path length of escaping rays. The mean path length can be calculated as follows (Campbell and Green 1987): P  ¼ t½2ð1  RÞ þ 4 fR þ 6Rð1  f Þð1  RÞ þ 8f ð1  f ÞR2 þ    ð4:4Þ Here f is fraction of light escaped/coupled out each time when light strikes the top surface and t is the thickness of absorbing material/substrate. The Eq. (4.4) can be expressed in power series form as (Campbell and Green 1987): P  ¼ 2tð X 1 m¼0 ½ð2m þ 1Þð1  RÞ þ ð2m þ 2ÞfR½Rð1  f ÞmÞ ð4:5Þ Equation (4.5) can be further reduced to form as given in Eq. (4.6) as follows: P  ¼ 2tð1 þ RÞ 1  Rð1  f Þ ð4:6Þ In limiting case where transmissivity at top surface is 100% and rear surface is perfect reﬂector (R = 1 or 100%), which would be an ideal condition for a solar cell, f would be 1/n2 as given in Eq. (4.3). In this scenario, mean path length would be 4tn2 where n is the refractive index of the absorbing material. This indicates a maximum possible path length enhancement of 4n2 for Lambertian light trapping geometry. Now if the rear surface is considered to be non-perfect reﬂector and also depends on total internal reﬂection then reﬂectance from rear surface (R) would be (1 f). In 68 4 Principle of Texturization for Enhanced Light Trapping such case the path length enhancement would come down to 2n2 (Campbell and Green 1987). For Si based solar cells in ideal condition with perfect back reﬂector, maximum possible path length enhancement for weekly absorbing light is about 4650. Also, the solid angle of escape cone (Xc) would be fraction of 4p and can be given by Eq. (4.7) (Yablonovitch 1982). Xc ¼ 4p 2n2 ð4:7Þ Solid angle of escape cone (Xc) can be linked to probability for light escape in one scattering event and this probability would be 1/2n2 where n is the refractive index of absorbing material (Yablonovitch 1982). In order to achieve enhanced light trapping in c-Si absorbing material, we need to ensure total internal reﬂection and probable angular randomization of light on subsequent reﬂections. If light is made to fall outside the escape cone, front escape of light would be minimized. For angular randomization and to make incident light fall at angle higher than the critical angle, surface texturing is done which results in random pyramids at Si surface as shown in Fig. 4.3b. When light incident on one surface (ray-1), it gets reﬂected and fall on another pyramid surface (ray-2 and ray-3 in Fig. 4.3b). Multiple interactions of light and interface increase the chances for inward coupling of light (ray-4). Also, after reﬂection from back surface, if it falls at angle larger than the critical angle (ray-3), total internal reﬂection would occur. Angle of incident can be tuned with the help of pyramid size, shape and angle of surface of each pyramid from base surface. Therefore by optimizing the surface morphology, the reﬂection from the front surface and front escape, i.e. light escape from front surface after getting reﬂected from back surface and reaching the front surface, can be minimized to a greater extent. As a result, enhanced light trapping can be achieved. 4.2 Textured Surfaces in c-Si Solar Cells As discussed in above section, randomizing the surface can enhance the light trapping in absorbing materials used in solar cell applications. For Si solar cells, it is infra-red wavelengths for which weak absorption is seen and the front escape for such weakly absorbed wavelengths is to be minimized. The wavelengths for which the front escape is to be minimized depends on the thickness of the absorbing material, as the need of front escape minimization comes for those wavelengths which reaches to front after getting reﬂected from back and do not get transmitted from front surface or absorbed within the absorbing material. The surface roughening can be of different types e.g. structures like regular pyramids, Lambertian (random surface roughness), random pyramids, inverted pyramids etc. In case of mono c-Si solar cells, random pyramids are used for light 4.1 Surface Morphology and Its Impact  69 trapping and in case of multi c-Si solar cells, honeycomb like structures are used for enhancing the light trapping. Figure 4.4a shows the schematic of a random pyra- mids like structured used in mono c-Si solar cells and Fig. 4.4b shows the sche- matic of honeycomb like structure useful for light trapping in multi c-Si wafer based cells. In case of mono c-Si wafers, different crystal planes have different atomic density. Typical mono c-Si wafers used for solar cells have (100) orientation. For such wafers (100) and (111) planes have different density of atoms. In this situation, chemical etching results in different etching rate in different plane direction (ani- sotropic etching), which results in formation of random pyramid. However, in case of multi c-Si wafers, the crystal grains have different orientations and very few have the required (100) orientation which can be used for pyramid formation using etching process. This leads to non-uniform and higher reﬂectance across the wafer. For multi c-Si solar cells, uniform texturing is required, which should be isotropic and independent of crystal orientation. More detail about the process requirements for such structures have been discussed in next chapter. The pyramid arrangement for light tapping in mono c-Si solar cells can be in regular pattern, random pattern or in brickwork arrangement. In regular pyramid layout, each pyramid size is same and the pyramids are at regular interval (see Fig. 4.5a). In random pyramid arrangement, the pyramids are of different sizes at random spatial locations (see Fig. 4.5b). In brickwork arrangement, each pyramid is shifted from base center from the neighboring pyramid (see Fig. 4.5c). The other arrangement is perpendicular slat as shown in Fig. 4.5d where the sides of groves are formed by anisotropic etching as done for pyramid structure fabrication (Campbell and Green 1987). Based on geometrical analysis, it has been shown that 40% of rays striking the surface in regular pyramid arrangement and 44% in random pyramid arrangement do not escape even after getting reﬂected from reﬂective rear surface and passing through the absorbing material reaching the top having structured surface Campbell and Green (1987). In brickwork arrangement, 80% of rays striking the surface do not escape after passing through structured surface at top and reﬂective rear surface. Double side textured surface or perpendicular slat geometry perform much better than the single side structured surface at top and reﬂective rear surface based light trapping structures and their performance is closer to Lambertian light trapping (a) (b) Random pyramids Honey-comb structures Fig. 4.4 Schematic of light trapping structures a random pyramid based structures used in mono c-Si solar cells; b honeycomb like structures used in multi c-Si solar cells 70 4 Principle of Texturization for Enhanced Light Trapping geometry. Random size inverted pyramids have also been shown to give better light trapping (Green et al. 1999) (see Fig. 4.5e). The best c-Si cell efﬁciency has been reported with inverted pyramid based light trapping structure (Green et al. 1999). Theoretically, the best performance (light trapping) can be achieved for com- pletely randomized surface (Lambertian surface) where almost 100% (theoretically) of rays striking the surface would not escape even after getting reﬂected from reﬂective rear surface and passing through the absorbing material reaching the top surface (Campbell and Green 1987). However, such ideal structure is far from reality. Therefore, for enhanced light trapping in mono c-Si solar cells mostly random pyramids (see Fig. 4.6a) are used and for multi c-Si solar cells honeycomb like structures (see Fig. 4.6b) are used.

(Campbell and Green 1987)); e arrangement of random inverted pyramid (two sizes) (top view) (after Ref. (Green et al. 1999)) 4.2 Textured Surfaces in c-Si Solar Cells 71 4.3 Role of Texture Size and Shape in Light Trapping and Reﬂection Reduction As we discussed in above section, there are many light trapping structures which can be used to enhance the absorption. However, the potential of amount of light trapping is very much depends on the shape and the size of the light trapping structure. The pyramids, most widely used structure for light trapping in c-Si solar cells, are deﬁned by four (111) planes and one (100) base plane in mono c-Si wafer whose surface is terminated at (100) crystal orientation. The pyramid can be upright or inverted as shown in Fig. 4.7. Angle between (100) base and (111) plane, also known as characteristic angle (h), is about 54.7 for the case of mono c-Si wafers. The height (h) or depth (d) (in case of inverted pyramid) of pyramid can be calculated from base dimension using Eq. (4.8) where l is the length of the base. The height/depth of the pyramid is also known as pyramid size. h ¼ tan h  l 2 ð4:8Þ In mono c-Si solar cells, regular/random pyramids are used and the size of pyramid may vary from 110 lm. Pyramid structure sizes in the range of 510 lm is most widely used. Based on computer modeling (Campbell and Green 1987) calculated the fraction of light rays that remains trapped as function of number of passes made through the absorbing material where the top surface has different light trapping geometries and rear surface is considered reﬂective. The calculated histogram plot is shown in Fig. 4.8. It can be clearly seen that the Lambertian light trapping geometry is best among all, as the fraction of light that remains trapped is maximum for this type of light trapping geometry and the hence the fraction of light rays that would escape and adds up to the reﬂection from the surface (for weekly absorbing light) would be minimum. The brickwork pattern based light trapping geometry (Fig. 4.5d) is also Fig. 4.6 SEM image of a a mono c-Si wafer with random pyramids at surface (from Ref. (Singh 2016) (cross-sectional view), reproduced with permission); b a multi c-Si wafer with honeycomb like structure on surface (from Ref. (Nishimoto 1999), Reproduced by permission of The Electrochemical Society.) 72 4 Principle of Texturization for Enhanced Light Trapping competitive. In pyramid based light trapping geometry, random pyramid geometry is shown to give better performance than the regular pyramids. In case of multi c-Si based absorbing material, honeycomb like textures, usually achieved by isotropic etching of the surface, are used for light trapping as discussed in previous section. The reﬂection in such multi c-Si based absorbing material is governed by width (W) and depth (d) of the texture as shown in Fig. 4.9. The honeycomb structure can be assumed to part of an imaginary sphere with radius r and the width (W), depth (d) and radius can be related as: θ θ (a) (b) Fig. 4.7 Schematic of a upright pyramid with height h and characteristic angle h between planes (111) and base (100); b inverted pyramid with depth d and characteristic angle h between planes (111) and base (100) for case of mono c-Si wafers Fig. 4.8 Fraction of light rays that remains trapped as function of number passes made through the absorbing material where the top surface has different light trapping geometries and rear surface is considered reﬂective (Reproduced from (Campbell and Green 1987), with permission of AIP Publishing) 4.3 Role of Texture Size and Shape in Light  73 W2 ¼ 8rd4d2 ð4:9Þ The reﬂectance from such structures can be calculated as (Nishimoto 1999): R ¼ X k þ 1 m¼0 Rm;1  dSm S ð4:10Þ where Rm,1 represents the reﬂectance from individual points (Am,1(xm,1,ym,1), for m = 0, 1, 2, 3k) which divides the half texture into k parts and dSm and S is given as per Eqs. (4.11) and (4.12) respectively. dSm ¼ pðy2 m;1  y2 m þ 1;1Þ ð4:11Þ S ¼ p  ðW 2 Þ2 ð4:12Þ where xm;1 ¼ m  W 2k and ym;1 ¼ ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ r2  x2 m;1 q are point co-ordinates for m = 0, 1, 2,k. Above equations indicate the dependency of reﬂectance on width (W) and depth (d) of the texture. For small value of d/W, the change in reﬂectance is not signif- icant. However for lager value of d/W, reﬂectance reduction is observed (Nishimoto 1999). It means textures with larger value of d/W ratio would be required for better reﬂection reduction. As an example, d/W value of about 0.5 result in minimum reﬂection for a 600 nm wavelength of light as per calculation done by Nishimoto (1999). x y θm θm θm θt W d r Am1 Am2 Origin Fig. 4.9 Schematic of a texture design used for reﬂection reduction in multi c-Si based absorbing material (after Ref. (Nishimoto 1999)) 74 4 Principle of Texturization for Enhanced Light Trapping The above discussions clearly show the sensitivity to light trapping geometry/shape and size on light trapping potential. Type of surface structure as well as optimum size and shape is necessary for efﬁcient light trapping and reﬂection reduction. 4.4 Single Side Texturing Versus Both Side Texturing As discussed above in pyramid based light trapping geometry for the case of single side textured surfaces, maximum light is escaped after just two passes and only 40 44% remains trapped (see Fig. 4.8). This was the case where light was escaping after getting reﬂected from reﬂective rear surface and passing through the absorbing material reaching the top having textured surface. However, this light escape can be further minimized by texturing both side of Si (absorbing material/substrate) which can enhance the light trapping further. Pyramidal textured surface at both side of the Si substrate greatly reduces the front escape due to more randomization of light rays hitting the bottom surface. The fraction of light rays that remains trapped as function of number passes made through the absorbing material as calculated by Campbell and Green (1987) based on computer modeling, where the top and bottom surface has same kind of light trapping geometry and rear surface has been considered reﬂective, is shown in Fig. 4.10. It can be clearly noticed from Fig. 4.10 that double side pyramidal texture based light trapping structure (see Fig. 4.11b) performs much better than single side pyramidal texture based light trapping structure (see Fig. 4.11a). Also, double side random pyramidal texture based light trapping structure in this case also have better light trapping potential than regular pyramidal texture based light trapping structure. Random double side pyramidal texture based light trapping Fig. 4.10 Fraction of light rays that remains trapped as function of number passes made through the absorbing material where the top and bottom surface has same kind of light trapping geometry and rear surface has been considered reﬂective (Reproduced from (Campbell and Green 1987), with permission of AIP Publishing) 4.3 Role of Texture Size and Shape in Light  75 structure is even indicating the light trapping potential closer to Lambertian light trapping scheme for the initial passes of light. The other arrangement, perpendicular slat, (as in Fig. 4.5d), which has sides of groves formed at both sides of Si, is also competitive to Lambertian light trapping geometry. For case of Lambertian light trapping geometry, there is not much difference between single side and both side roughening based light trapping structure (see Fig. 4.8 and Fig. 4.10). In case of commercial mono c-Si solar cells, it is required to use cost effective and easily implementable structure. Random pyramids can be formed by aniso- tropic etching which is cost effective and more practical structure for mono c-Si based solar cells. Therefore, while fabricating mono c-Si solar cells, pyramidal textures are formed at both sides of the Si substrate, is used as shown in Fig. 4.11b. This light trapping structure provides higher current generation from the cell compared to single side pyramidal textures based light trapping geometry. 4.5 Most Suitable Textured Surface for Better Light Trapping As discussed above, there are many structure/geometry which can be used for enhancing the light trapping in c-Si based solar cells. The discussions till now were based on how much path length enhancement can be achieved and how much light can be trapped. However, for real solar cell application one has to decide on which light trapping structure should be used for higher current generation from the solar cells under given solar spectrum, depending on its cost effectiveness. The current generation from solar cell would depend on optical properties of the active absorbing material as well as light trapping scheme. For terrestrial application, the evaluation of current generation potential for different light trapping structures should be based on AM 1.5G radiation spectrum (Standard IEC 60904-3 2008). Based on computer program, (Campbell and Green 1987) presented the current contribution from different light trapping structures on different thicknesses of silicon solar cells. The graph plot has been shown in Fig. 4.12. Figure 4.12 analysis (b) Absorbing material/Si R (a) Absorbing material/Si Fig. 4.11 Schematic of Si substrate (absorbing material) with a single side (top) pyramidal textured surface and reﬂecting bottom surface; b double side (top and bottom) pyramidal textured surface and reﬂecting bottom surface 76 4 Principle of Texturization for Enhanced Light Trapping indicate that the best light trapping structure would be perpendicular slat which is competitive with the Lambertian light trapping structure. Also, the random pyramid on both side of the cell has similar kind of current generation potential. The single side pyramidal texture either regular or random has lower current generation potential than the both side pyramidal texture based light trapping geometry. Random pyramidal texture at both side surface (front and back) is more suitable light trapping structure from cost and implementation point of view and is widely used scheme in c-Si solar cell manufacturing. The above analysis is based on assumption that there is 100% transmissivity from top surface to the Si absorbing material for incident light at any angle. However in case of rear surface, there will always be some reﬂection from the front which may vary for different angle of incidence and would result in relatively lower current generation. The current generation potential for different light trapping geometry can be calculated using following Eq. (4.13) (Davis et al. 2015): JG ¼ q: Z /phðkÞ:Tf ðkÞ:eaðkÞ:ZðkÞ:t:dk ð4:13Þ where q is electron charge, /phðkÞ is photon ﬂux of spectrum under consideration e.g. AM 1.5G, Tf ðkÞ is transmission into the cell from air-Si interface at front, aðkÞ is absorption co-efﬁcient of Si at wavelength k. Z(k) is optical path length enhancement of the cell for wavelength k and t is cell (absorbing material) thickness. The maximum optical path length enhancement (Z(k)) is 4n(k)2 where n(k) is refractive index of Si at wavelength k as discussed in Sect. 4.1. There are some more expressions/models are available for Z(k) as given below(PV-Lighthouse): Fig. 4.12 Maximum current generation potential (short circuit current) for different thicknesses of c-Si solar cells with different light trapping structures under AM 1.5G spectrum with integrated intensity of 97 mW/cm2 (Reproduced from (Campbell and Green 1987), with permission of AIP Publishing) 4.5 Most Suitable Textured Surface  77 ZðkÞ ¼ lnð1 þ 4nðkÞ2:aðkÞ:tÞ aðkÞ:t ð4:14Þ Z ¼ 4 þ ln½n2ðkÞ þ ð1  n2ðkÞÞ:e4:aðkÞ:t aðkÞ:t ð4:15Þ Z(k) given in Eqs. (4.14) and (4.15) leads to 4n(k)2 as aðkÞ.t tends to zero, which is limiting case. Equation (4.13) shows the maximum current achievable from the cell. However, there are reﬂection losses from front and other parasitic absorption losses can lead to lesser current generation potential. The losses in form of reﬂection or parasitic absorption can be represented in current loss form as given in following Equations: JR ¼ q: Z /phðkÞ:Rf ðkÞ:eaðkÞ:ZðkÞ:t:dk ð4:16Þ JA ¼ q: Z /phðkÞ:Af ðkÞ:eaðkÞ:ZðkÞ:t:dk ð4:17Þ where Rf ðkÞ represent reﬂection from front surface and Af ðkÞ represent parasitic absorption at front interface which is not transmitted nor reﬂected from the inter- face. Open source simulation software are available e.g. ray tracer from PV-light house (PV-Lighthouse) which can be used to calculate the optical path length enhancement in Si material at different wavelengths for different light trapping structure. Also, it calculates the equivalent current generation potential and current losses associated reﬂection and parasitic absorption. The pyramidal texture is more suitable light trapping structure and widely used scheme in c-Si solar cell manufacturing as discussed above. Further, there are two possible types of pyramids which can be used are upright pyramid and inverted pyramid respectively. Performance comparison of such structures (upright and inverted pyramid) using ray tracer can be done. Monte Carlo ray tracing method is used in ray tracing (PV-Lighthouse)following the laws of geometrical optics. Figure 4.13a shows path length enhancement for weekly absorbing light in Si as calculated by wafer ray tracer (PV-Lighthouse) in case upright pyramidal light trapping geometry with mean pyramid size of 5 lm in 200 lm c-Si wafers. Figure 4.13b shows path length enhancement for inverted pyramidal light trapping geometry with similar geometrical features. In both cases, the AM1.5G light spectrum is used and simulated light has been allowed to fall on surface at 0 from normal. The back surface has been assumed to be perfectly reﬂecting (R = 1). It can be seen from Fig. 4.13a, b that in both cases random pyramids at front and rear result in highest path length enhancement for the weekly absorbing light compared to all other light trapping schemes. Hence for c-Si solar cells, both side texturization would be the best choice. Now for choice between inverted and upright pyramid structure, current generation potential can be estimated. 78 4 Principle of Texturization for Enhanced Light Trapping An example can be seen in Fig. 4.14 for four different light trapping schemes. It shows maximum possible photogeneration for above disused case of 200 lm cell with mean pyramid size of 5 lm. This analysis based on current generation potential evaluation for the four dif- ferent light trapping schemes in two cases, i.e., upright pyramids and inverted pyramid case, indicate that inverted pyramid based light trapping structure is better than upright pyramid based light trapping structure. And randomness of the pyra- mid at both surface also leads to more current generation. In summary, we can say that the random inverted pyramid at both side of solar cell surface would be the best choice as light trapping structure. Here note that the above discussed analysis is for normal incidence light assuming the rear is perfect reﬂector. However, there can be parasitic absorption at front and rear surface and the rear surface may not be perfect reﬂector in practical situations in solar cells which may impact the total current generation potential of the said light trapping structures. Readers can perform their Fig. 4.13 Path length enhancement for weekly absorbing light in Si as calculated by ray tracer (PV-Lighthouse) in case pyramidal light trapping geometry with mean pyramid size of 5 lm in 200 lm c-Si wafers for (a) upright pyramid case; (b) inverted pyramid case 4.5 Most Suitable Textured Surface  79 own simulations of different light schemes in different conditions using open source wafer ray tracer simulation software available at PV light house (PV-Lighthouse). 4.6 Implication of Texturing Based Light Trapping Structure All the discussions made in this chapter were for texture/surface roughening based light trapping. By texturing/roughening of the surface, the reﬂection from Si can be minimized from 4042 to 1215% (total reﬂectance) as shown in Fig. 4.15. It shows measured total reﬂectance from c-Si wafer having polished surface and both side chemically textured surface respectively. Reﬂectance in the range of 1215% for texture surface based light trapping scheme is still considered high and should be further minimized. Texturing or surface roughening of Si creates many recombination centers at surface and results in creation of unsaturated dangling bonds as discussed in Sect. 3.5 of the previous chapter. In case of pyramidal texture based light trapping geometry, the texture surface have more area covered by (111) planes which has relatively more defect states. It would lead to more surface recombination proba- bility compared to planer (100) surface in c-Si wafer based cells and would result in poor cell performance (Fesquet et al. 2009; McIntosh and Johnson 2009). For Fig. 4.14 Current generation potential for a 200 lm cell with mean pyramid size of 5 lm in case of upright pyramid structure and inverted pyramid structure with different light trapping schemes 80 4 Principle of Texturization for Enhanced Light Trapping addressing the surface recombination issue due to roughening of surface, dielectric based surface passivation is done as discussed in previous chapter (Sect. 3.5). This dielectric passivation layer with optimized thickness and refractive index also act as anti-reﬂection layer on textured surface based light trapping structure. It helps in reducing the reﬂection from surface further and enhances the light trapping in solar cells which leads to better solar cell performance. More about combination of dielectric thin ﬁlm and textured surface based light trapping structure and relative impact on solar cell performance has been discussed in Chap. 6. 4.7 Questions and Problems 1.

Starting with c-Si crystal structure and role of crystal planes, wafer type and orientation in deciding the chemical process chemistry for texturing has been covered. Also, chemical processes used for achieving different shape of textures on surface in mono- as well as multi c-Si wafers has been discussed along with the principle behind the process, which makes texturization possible. At the end, practical implications involved in chemical texturing based technology has been discussed in context of manufacturing of the c-Si solar cells. 5.1 Si Crystal Structure The spatial arrangements of atoms or ions are characterized by crystal structures. In crystalline material, periodicity in atoms or group of atoms arranged in particular sequence are observed for long atomic distances. Atoms or ions/molecules are bound in a repetitive three-dimensional pattern with its nearest neighboring atoms or ions/molecules. Different type of crystal structures leads to different types of physical properties of materials. There are many types of crystal structure exists in nature. The atoms or ions/molecules are considered as solid sphere with well-deﬁned diameters when the crystal structure is represented for understanding the material system and properties. The term lattice is used where it represent three-dimensional array of points coinciding with atom positions (Callister and Rethwisch 2007). The repetitive arrangements of a group of atoms or ions/molecules, also called unit cell, is mostly used to represent the crystal structure of solid materials. The unit cell represents the symmetry of crystal structure and by translation of the unit cell with integral distances, in the three-dimensional space along its edges; the whole crystal can be generated. In such case, the unit cell act as basic structure or building block of a crystalline material (see Fig. 5.1). There may exist more than  Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017 C.S. Solanki and H.K. Singh, Anti-reﬂection and Light Trapping in c-Si Solar Cells, Green Energy and Technology, DOI 10.1007/978-981-10-4771-8_5 83 on unit cell in a crystal. However, unit cell having highest level of geometrical symmetry is considered (Callister and Rethwisch 2007). There are many types of crystal structure and are divided in groups based on unit cell arrangement or atomic arrangements. The unit cell is usually deﬁned by six parameters where the unit cell is considered as parallelepiped with origin at one corner and edges in x, y, z direction with edge lengths a, b, and c and inter-axial angles a, b, and c as shown in Fig. 5.2. The values of a, b, and c are termed as lattice parameters. There are total seven different combinations if a, b, and c with a, b, and c are deﬁned which collectively represents the crystal system namely cubic, hexagonal, rhombohedral, orthorhombic, tetragonal, monoclinic, and triclinic. c-Si material falls into cubic crystal system where a = b = c and a = b = c = 90. The cubic crystal system is further subdivided into three categories, i.e., simple cubic (SCC), body-centered cubic (BCC), and face-centered cubic (FCC), based on the location of lattice points (atoms) in the unit cell. In SCC structure, Unit cell Atoms/Ions Fig. 5.1 Symbolic representation of a crystal structure with periodic atoms/ions. The rectangular shape having representative atoms at its corners represents a unit cell x y z b a c α γ β Fig. 5.2 Schematic of a unit cell having edge lengths a, b and c along x, y and z directions and interaxial angles a, b and c. (after Ref. (Callister and Rethwisch 2007)) 84 5 Texturing Process of c-Si Wafers there exist one lattice point at each corner of the cube and each atom at the lattice point is shared by adjacent cubes equally (see Fig. 5.3a). In SCC structure, each unit cell will have one effective atom as each lattice point would have eight adjacent possible cubes sharing the atom on lattice point equally. So eight corners of cube contributing one-eighth of the atom in the cell leads to 8  1/8 = 1 atom per unit cell. In BCC structure, there exists one lattice point at the center of unit cell along with eight lattice points at the corner (see Fig. 5.3b). This additional atom at central lattice point increases the share of atoms per unit cell to 2. In FCC crystal structure, there exists one lattice point at each face of the cube in addition to lattice points at the corners (see Fig. 5.3c). The atoms at lattice points on faces are shared by neighboring cube face and effective share of atom of this face to the unit cell is ½. There are total six faces in cube leading effective eight atoms from faces and one from corners and total share of atoms per unit cell is increased to 4. Silicon material has diamond cubic lattice structure which is visualized as two merged face-centered cubic (FCC) lattices where the origin of second lattice originates from the ﬁrst by a/4 (a is lattice constant of Si) in each direction. The unit cell representation of diamond crystal structure is shown in Fig. 5.4. In diamond crystal structure, there are total eight atoms per unit cell (one equivalent atom from corners, three equivalent atoms from faces of cube, and four (a) (b) (c) Fig. 5.3 Schematic of a simple cubic structure (SCC); b body centered cubic structure (BCC); c face centered cubic structure (FCC) Diamond structure a Fig. 5.4 Schematic of a unit cell of diamond cubic crystal structure (crystal structure found in Si material) 5.1 Si Crystal Structure 85 from inside of cell). The lattice constant (a) for Si is 0.543 nm. The density of Si atoms is given by numbers of atoms per unit cell volume which is about 5  1022 atoms/cm3. In mono c-Si materials, unit cell/atom periodicity occurs for longer range/ distances, across the dimensions of the wafer. However, there are possibilities where unit cell or atom arrangement/periodicity may occur for short or very short distance. Such structure would exhibit polycrystalline structures or microcrystalline structure. Monocrystalline and polycrystalline structure based Si wafers used in c-Si solar cell manufacturing has already been discussed in Sect. 2.2 of Chap. 2. In the following section, we would discuss the crystal orientation of wafer preferred for solar cell manufacturing. 5.2 Wafer Type and Orientation for c-Si Solar Cell Fabrication Orientation of planes for a crystal structure is represented by Miller indices (hkl). Note that the h, k, and l values, i.e., Miller indices are evaluated from inverse of side edge lengths of the crystal structure unit cell. It means if x-intercept of plane in the unit cell is a, then h would be 1/a. Similarly, if y and z-intercept of planes are b and c, respectively, then k and l would be 1/b and 1/c, respectively. So, (hkl) would have fractional intercepts as 1/a, 1/b, 1/c. The fractional intercepts are multiplied or divided by a common number in order to simplify them. For example, if the fraction intercepts are 1/3, 1/2, 1/4; then the miller indices would be written as (463). Further, parallel planes are equivalent and represented by identical indices. For example, a crystal plane is represented by (hkl) where h is inverse of x-intercept of plane, k is inverse of y-intercept of plane, and l is inverse of z-intercept of plane as discussed above. Also, the equivalent planes are represented by {hkl} and the crystal direction is represented by [hkl]. The equivalent crystal directions are rep- resented by hkl. In Si-based semiconductor device manufacturing, (100) and (111) are the two principal silicon crystal orientations which are widely used (Plummer et al. 2000). Wafer having orientations like (100) or (111) indicates that the Si crystal terminates at the wafer surface on [100] or [111]. Figure 5.5 shows some important cubical crystal miller indices. In the ﬁgure, you can see the intercepts of plane on the axis. In the extreme left ﬁgure, the shaded region represent the (100) plane. Similarly, middle and extreme right ﬁgures show the (110) and (111) planes respectively. The h, k or l value equals to zero (0) means the axial intercept along x, y, or z axis is inﬁnite (1). This means it is parallel to that particular axis. The 100, 110 and 111 direction view of diamond cubic crystal structure and atomic arrangements would look different which can be seen in Fig. 5.6. Also, the (100), (110) and (111) plane of a Si crystal can be seen in Fig. 5.7. 86 5 Texturing Process of c-Si Wafers In c-Si solar cell, for etching the surface and to form pyramidal structure, ani- sotropic etching is required. The rate of etching depends on the number of atoms in given direction. In such scenario, it becomes important to know the number of atoms in given direction/plane. To calculate number of atoms per unit area for a 100 direcƟon view 110 direcƟon view 111 direcƟon view Fig. 5.6 Si crystal structure (diamond crystal structure) unit cell view in 100, 110 and 111 directions (100) plane (110) plane (111) plane a a 2a 2a 2a Fig. 5.7 Atoms in (100), (110) and (111) plane of c-Si cubic crystal structure (100) (010) (001) x y z a a a 0 x y z a a a 0 x y z a a a 0 (110) (111) 2a 2a Fig. 5.5 Schematic of some important cubical crystal miller indices (after Ref. (Sze and Ng 2006)) 5.2 Wafer Type and Orientation for c-Si Solar Cell Fabrication 87 given plane, we need to know the area of each plane and number of effective atoms in that plane. If a is the lattice constant for Si(which is 0.543 nm), then, one can calculate the value of each side for given plane as shown in Fig. 5.7. And accordingly, the area of each plane can be calculated as follows: Area of 100 ð Þ plane would be A100 ¼ a  a ¼ a2 ¼ 0:295  1014cm2 Area of 110 ð Þ plane would be A110 ¼ a  ﬃﬃ 2 p a ¼ ﬃﬃ 2 p a2 ¼ 0:417  1014cm2 Area of 111 ð Þ plane would be A111 ¼ 1 2  ﬃﬃ 2 p a  ﬃﬃ 3 p ﬃﬃ 2 p a ¼ ﬃﬃ 3 p 2 a2 ¼ 0:255  1014cm2 Now, for (100) plane, there would be four atoms at the corner leading to effective 4  1/4 = 1 atoms and 1 atom in the middle entirely for plane. So total effective atoms in (100) plane (N100) would be 1 + 1 = 2. For (110) plane, again there would be four atoms at the corner leading to effective 4  1/4 = 1 atoms and two atoms in the middle entirely for plane. Also, two more atoms at the side shared by neighboring cells leading to total effective atoms in (110) plane (N110) to (4  1/4) + 2 + (2  1/2) = 4. Similarly, for (111) plane, there would be three atoms at the corner shared by ﬁve more neighboring cells, which leads to effective 3  1/6 = 1/2 atoms. Also, three atoms shared between two unit cells contribute 3  1/2 effective atoms to this plane. Hence total effective atom in (111) plane (N111) would be 3/2 + 1/2 = 2. So, the density of atoms for given plane can be calculated as follows: Density of atoms in 100 ð Þ plane ¼ N100=A100 ¼ 2=a2 ¼ 6:78  1014atoms=cm2 Density of atoms in 110 ð Þ plane ¼ N110=A110 ¼ 4= ﬃﬃ 2 p a2 ¼ 9:59  1014atoms=cm2 Density of atoms in 111 ð Þ plane ¼ N111=A111 ¼ 2= ﬃﬃ 3 p =2   a2 ¼ 7:84  1014atoms=cm2 As discussed above that (111) and (100) are the two principal silicon crystal orientations which are widely used. Now to decide which one is better for c-Si solar cells, the above analysis of atom density can be used to decide. It can be clearly seen that the (111) planes in Si crystal has more number of silicon atoms/cm2 and (100) plane has lowest atoms/cm2. It means (111) plane-based c-Si wafers would have higher densities of electrical defects (interface states) and unsaturated bonds which may result in increased surface recombination compared to (100) plane based c-Si wafers. So, the (100) surface would have better electrical properties than (111) surface. This makes (100) plane-based c-Si wafers more useful and is used in majority in c-Si based solar cell industry. And also, the difference in atomic density along different planes makes it possible to get different etching rate in different crystal plane direction by choosing the appropriate chemistry. The anisotropic etching is important in achieving the pyramidal textures in mono c-Si wafer based solar cells. 88 5 Texturing Process of c-Si Wafers 5.3 Chemical Process for Texturing As discussed in previous chapter, for enhanced light trapping in wafer based c-Si solar cells, random surface roughening is required. Fabrication of random pyramids or honeycomb-like structures on Si wafer surface would be able to provide desired surface roughening and enhanced light trapping. For achieving such surface roughening, chemical etching is the most widely used method. Since (100) c-Si wafers are preferably used in mono c-Si wafer based solar cells, anisotropic etching based on alkaline chemical solution (sodium hydroxide (NaOH) or potassium hydroxide (KOH) based) is the best selection for achieving random pyramids on Si wafer surface. Anisotropic etching method utilizes the different etching rate in different crystal direction due to different atomic density as discussed in above section. Chemical etching rate in (111) direction is less compared to (100) direction and this result in pyramid structure formation which has base (100) and four faces of pyramid with (111) plane as shown in Fig. 5.8a and b. In multi c-Si wafers, isotropic etching is required as it contains crystal grains having different orientation of crystal planes. Since grains having (100) crystal plane, required for pyramidal structure formation, may be relatively very less and effective texturization would not be achieved with alkaline chemical solution. Therefore alkaline chemical solution based anisotropic etching does not work well in multi c-Si wafers and leads to nonuniform reﬂection from surface. Those regions on wafer surface which have grains with (100) plane are well textured and results in lower reﬂections; and those regions that do not have preferred crystal plane are not textured properly and lead to relatively high reﬂection from surface. For texturing of the multi c-Si wafers, acidic solution (hydroﬂuoric acid (HF) and nitric acid (HNO3)) are typically used which leads to isotropic etching of the surface and is (a) (b) Fig. 5.8 a Schematic for 3D view of (100) and (111) plane having different etching rate; b two dimensional schematic of a pyramid structure having base with (100) plane and pyramid faces (111) plane 5.3 Chemical Process for Texturing 89 independent of crystal orientation. The alkaline and acidic chemical processes for mono and multi c-Si wafer texturing as been discussed below: a) Alkaline Chemical Process for Mono c-Si Wafer Texturing In alkaline solution based surface texturing, sodium hydroxide (NaOH) or potas- sium hydroxide (KOH) and de-ionized water (DI) are used along with organic agents like isopropyl alcohol (IPA). Optimization is done for volume ratios of these chemicals as per process requirements. In such chemical solutions, etching rate of Si in (100) plane is highest and is lowest in (111) plane as already shown in Fig. 5.8a. For texturing the Si wafers, the wafers are submerged vertically in the solution of KOH/NaOH, IPA, and DI with optimized volume ratios. This chemical solution, also referred as chemical bath, is kept around 80 C temperature. The chemical reaction mechanism involved in the process is as follows: KOH or NaOH provide hydroxyl ions (OH) which reacts with silicon and forms Si(OH)4. Si(OH)4 further reacts with hydroxyl ions and forms negative SiO2(OH)2 and water molecule. The chemical reaction is given below NaOH=KOH þ H2O ! Na þ =K þ þ OH Si þ 2OH þ 2H2O ! Si OH ð Þ4 þ H2 Si OH ð Þ4 þ 2OH ! SiO2 OH ð Þ 2 þ 2H2O In this reaction, the role of IPA is to control the etching rate of Si and it does not participate in the chemical reaction directly. It helps to achieve good Si surface wettability and hence pyramidal structure uniformity across the wafer. Note that this chemical process result in upright pyramid structure as shown in Fig. 5.9a. Inverted pyramids can also be fabricated with slight modiﬁcation in process sequence. For fabricating inverted pyramid, usually photolithography Fig. 5.9 SEM image of a textured mono c-Si surface (side view) having upright pyramid (from Ref. (Singh 2016), reproduced with permission); b textured mono c-Si surface (top view) having inverted pyramids ((Sivasubramaniam and Alkaisi 2014), Reprinted from Microelectron Eng, 119, Sivasubramaniam S, Alkaisi MM, Inverted nanopyramid texturing for silicon solar cells using interference lithography, 146150, 2014, with permission from Elsevier) 90 5 Texturing Process of c-Si Wafers technique is used. A typical SEM image of inverted pyramid based light trapping structure on c-Si wafer is shown in Fig. 5.9b. In photolithography process, a photoresist is deposited on Si wafer coated with thermal oxide. A typical schematic of process steps involved in photolithography based inverted pyramid fabrication is shown in Fig. 5.10. After photoresist deposition, interference lithography is done for opening holes through photoresist which is latter exposed to dry etching (usually plasma etching) to transfer photoresist pattern to thermal oxide. After pattern transfer to thermal oxide, the wafer under process is exposed in KOH/NaOH + IPA + DI water chemical solution for surface etching as discussed above. This forms the inverted pyramid on the surface. After inverted pyramid formation, thermal oxide mask is removed using buffer oxide etchant. b) Acidic Chemical Process for Multi c-Si Wafer Texturing In acidic solution based surface texturing, hydroﬂuoric acid (HF), nitric acid (HNO3) and de-ionized water (DI) is used which etches silicon isotropically. Different volume ratios of these chemicals are used and optimized as per process requirements. In the etching process, HNO3 oxidizes Si surface and forms silicon oxide (SiO2). The formed SiO2 on Si surface are removed by HF. A water soluble complex (H2SiF6) gets formed by reacting with SiO2 layer. The chemical reaction equations are as follows (Cheng et al. 2011): 3Si þ 4HNO3 ! 3SiO2 þ 2H2O þ 4NO  SiO2 þ 6HF ! H2SiF6 þ 2H2O The etching rate for such solution is independent of crystal orientation and can be controlled by controlling the volume ratio of HF:HNO3:DI water. Acetic acid (CH3COOH) or phosphoric acid (H3PO4) is also used to moderate the etching rate (Nishimoto 1999). CH3COOH or H3PO4 has lower dielectric constant than water Si (100) Si (100) Si (100) Photo resist Photo resist paƩering by lithography technique Si (100) KOH/IPA etching through photo resist paƩern SiO2 mask removal by buﬀered oxide etch Thermal SiO2 Fig. 5.10 Typical process sequence for fabricating inverted pyramid based light trapping structure (after Ref. (Sivasubramaniam and Alkaisi 2014)) 5.3 Chemical Process for Texturing 91 and help in controlling the dissociation of HNO3 and result in higher oxidation power of etching solution. Also, CH3COOH or H3PO4 help in achieving proper wetting of Si wafer surface which is hydrophobic in nature. The acidic solution based texturing works better when surface is rough and hence as-cut wafers are preferred. Also, it requires temperature controlled environment (usually bath tem- perature 8 C) as these solutions result in exothermic reactions (Einhaus et al. 1997). A typical isotropic etching based textured Si surface SEM is shown in Fig. 5.11. Also, to form honeycomb-like structure with control over depth and width of the targeted texture shape using chemical process, laser assisted surface texturing is done. In this process (see Fig. 5.12), ﬁrst the full area is of wafer surface is coated with dielectric masking layer (usually silicon nitride) for masking purpose which is partially opened using lasers. Fig. 5.11 SEM image of a multi c-Si wafer with isotropic etching based surface (from Ref. (Nishimoto 1999), reproduced by permission of The Electrochemical Society) Si Dielectric layer for mask Si Si Si Laser assisted mask opening Etching through mask opening Mask removal Fig. 5.12 Typical process sequence for fabricating honeycomb like textured surface (after Ref. (Volk et al. 2013)) 92 5 Texturing Process of c-Si Wafers After opening the masked layer with laser, the partially opened masked layer is exposed to HNO3/HF chemical as discussed above for isotropic etching of Si surface. After removal of top dielectric masking layer, usually by buffered HF solution, honeycomb-like structure on multi c-Si wafer surface becomes visible. In this process, use of laser processing helps in producing homogenous hexagonal pattern and more control for adjusting the process and honeycomb structure based surface morphology (Volk et al. 2013). 5.4 Process Control for Texture Pyramids Size and Shape Distribution Rate of etching and the shape of structures formed on the surface are important parameters of texturing process. In anisotropic etching using KOH/NaOH + IPA + DI water solution and isotropic etching using HNO3 + HF + DI water solution, the volume ratio of chemical used in texturing process decides the etching rate. For example, in KOH:IPA:DI-based chemical solution used in pyramidal texturing of c-Si wafers, IPA concentration plays a major role in etching rate of Si surface and uniformity of pyramidal surface. If the IPA is not present in chemical solution, the etching rate would be very high (Quiebras 2013) and pyramidal shape formation on texture surface would be least probable. Also, size of the pyramidal texture would depend on the time duration for which the wafer surface is subjected into etching solution. When the wafer surface is kept for longer time in etching solution, it would result in etching of higher thickness of Si surface, which leads to the for- mation of pyramids of larger size. This happens when etching rate is moderate and etching rate along different crystallographic planes are distinguishable. Etching of the Si surface for different times leads to different sizes of pyramids as size and size distribution of pyramid would depend on the total etched depth as well as efﬁciency of the chemical residue removal during etching for given process chemistry. Different size pyramids achieved with different etching times inﬂuences the reﬂectance from the surface which can be seen from Fig. 5.13. The duration of etching affects the distribution of pyramid shapes and their sizes. As the pyramid size and shape distribution changes, the reﬂectance from surface also changes. Also, there exist optimum size and shape for which minimum reﬂection would occur, hence the etching time should be properly optimized. Larger pyramid size or longer etching time does not mean more reﬂection reduction from the surface as can be seen in Fig. 5.13. It shows that the Si wafer surface etched for 40 min result in high reﬂection compared to 30 min etched surfaces. The minimum reﬂection can be noticed for an optimum etching time of 30 min in this case. Chemical bath tem- perature is also crucial which govern the chemical reaction and hence the etching rate. Generally, better etching and surface texturing is achieved at chemical bath temperature of 7080 C. So, to control the size and shape of texture surface in KOH + IPA + DI based chemical process, KOH and IPA concentration in DI 5.3 Chemical Process for Texturing 93 water, bath temperature as well as the etching duration must be optimized for getting minimum reﬂection from Si surface. Similarly, in HNO3 + HF + DI water chemical solution based isotropic etching process, the volume ratio of HNO3, HF, and etch rate controlling catalytic agent like CH3COOH/H3PO4 is important. The etch rate for Si using such chemical solution can be varied by varying the ratio of HNO3 and HF in DI water. Usually the chemical solution which is HNO3 rich, etches the surface uniformly and surface texture may not be visible. For texturing the multi c-Si wafers to get texture surface, HF rich chemical solution is required (Nishimoto 1999). However, a HF rich chemical solution leads to very high etching rate and may reduce the thickness of wafer signiﬁcantly which in result would reduce the wafer mechanical strength. To moderate the etching rate, catalytic agents like CH3COOH/H3PO4 comes into picture. Increasing proportion of CH3COOH/H3PO4 in HNO3 + HF + DI based chemical solution can decrease the etching rate by 510 times and would help in achieving better texture surface leading to minimum reﬂection for surface. 5.5 Industrial Processes Used for Surface Texturing In solar industry, thousands of wafers are processed every hour and hundreds of wafers are processed together in a batch for manufacturing c-Si solar cells. Usually as-cut wafers are used which are ﬁrst subjected to saw damage removal before texturing process using high etch rate solution having KOH/NaOH + DI water. This etches the wafers from both sides and then the batches of these wafers are moved to dilute chemical solutions having catalytic agent mixed in it which pro- vides better surface wettability and etching rate control as discussed above. For texturing mono c-Si wafers, hot KOH + IPA based chemical solutions are widely Fig. 5.13 Reﬂectance from etched Si wafers surface, etched for different times (25, 30, and 40 min). (after Ref. (Quiebras 2013)) 94 5 Texturing Process of c-Si Wafers used. For multi c-Si wafers, HNO3 + HF + DI water based chemical solution optimized for isotropic etching is widely used. For saw damage removal and texturing process, the wafers are kept in wafer cassettes (usually made of Teﬂon) vertically. The cassettes are loaded in holders which are automated and moves through the production unit passing in sequence for different unit processes involved in solar cell manufacturing. During texturing, the wafers are merged in chemical bath for optimized duration. During texturing process, gas bubbles, usually using hydrogen, are created to remove the residues from surface during texturing. Proper arrangements are made to avoid the wafer lifting and wafer breakage during chemical processing. Also, possible chemical spillage should be avoided. After texturing process, the wafers are rinsed several times in fresh DI water. An acid rinse is also given which neutralizes the residues of Na/K on Si wafer surface, if any. The neutralization of Na/K from Si wafer surface is important as its presence leads to impact the surface passivation of the cell and degrades its performance. After texturization, neutralization and ﬁnal rinse step, the wafers are dried in spinner and are moved for further processing for solar cell fabrication. 5.6 Practical Implications of Chemical Texturing Processes In surface texturing process of c-Si wafers, various alkaline or acidic chemical are used. At industry level, where thousands of cells are produced every day, chemical requirements are also huge. Huge requirement of chemicals poses problems of storing and managing the waste after use. During texturing process, large amount of water is also used for rinsing and texturing purpose which is also a matter of concern. The chemicals like KOH, NaOH, HF, and HNO3 are hazardous and pose serious threat to human body if not handled properly. So, for all the chemical-related processes and experiments, proper chemical uses practice is required. Hence, these chemicals should be handled in expert supervision; other- wise, it can lead to severe injury and even death. Also, storing and managing the waste require proper knowledge and expertise. The requirement of such chemicals and disposal of waste products after use, add up to the cost of solar cell manu- facturing besides negatively impacting the environment. Additionally, chemical processes inﬂuence the throughput and yield of solar cell manufacturing. If an alternative technique can be developed which can provide the cost effective solution for texturing or light trapping, without chemical processes, would be advantageous not only from cost and logistic point of view but also from environmental point of view. Several light trapping alternatives are being researched worldwide. Some important and relevant light trapping structures have been discussed in the subse- quent chapters. 5.5 Industrial Processes Used for Surface Texturing 95 5.7 Questions and Problems 1.

Also, implications and solutions have been discussed in context of next generation c-Si solar cells. Solar cell performance comparisons for different light trapping combinations shown in this chapter are based on simulated results. Material/semiconductor properties used in simulations for getting the cell electrical performance are based on most relevant c-Si solar cell device. Also, the anti-reﬂection properties of the considered device used in simulations are mostly based on actual measured values. 6.1 Primary Beneﬁt of Textured Surface in Combination with Anti-reﬂection Layer As we have seen in pervious chapters that only use of anti-reﬂection layer on c-Si wafer or texturization of wafer surface cannot be the optimum solution for reﬂection reduction as in each case the reﬂection does not reduce below 1215%. For better anti-reﬂection and light trapping, combination of both texturing as well as anti-reﬂection coating, would be required which brings down the reﬂection from c-Si wafer to 34% which is honorable. Figure 6.1 shows reﬂection from a 180 lm c-Si wafer having 80 nm silicon nitride (SiNx) based anti-reﬂection coating (ARC) on non-textured surface and on textured surface having 58 lm upright pyramids. Clear reduction in reﬂectance for the combination of ARC and texturing can be seen for broad wavelength range. This is main/primary beneﬁt of using ARC in combination of texture-based light trapping structure. The other beneﬁt of using dielectric-based ARC is reduction in surface recom- bination arising due to surface roughening as discussed in Sect. 3.5 of Chap. 3 and Sect. 4.6 of Chap. 4. Now let us see the relative gain in terms of solar cell  Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017 C.S. Solanki and H.K. Singh, Anti-reﬂection and Light Trapping in c-Si Solar Cells, Green Energy and Technology, DOI 10.1007/978-981-10-4771-8_6 99 performance due to improvement in anti-reﬂection from surface. The best way to compare the solar cell performance is simulation of cell assuming all parameters same except reﬂection. PC1D-based simulation (PC1D 5.9) is a simple yet effective tool for such comparison where actual reﬂectance data can be used in simulating the cell parameters. For comparisons, let us assume two scenarios, i.e., best cell con- dition and typical cell condition. In both case, let us assume the cell thickness is 180 lm and cell active area is 100 cm2. Considering base wafer as p-type having resistivity 1 Ω-cm and diffused n-type emitter with sheet resistance 50 Ω/sq having erfc diffusion proﬁle. Let us assume the junction depth of about 400 nm. The light source for simulation would be AM 1.5G spectrum with intensity 100 mW/cm2 which is meant for cell performance targeting terrestrial application. The simulation parameters for simulation of solar cell with actual reﬂectance proﬁle has been given in Table 6.1. In best cell and typical cell scenario, the cell parameters which are taken different are bulk minority carrier lifetime, front and back surface recombination velocity, series resistance, and shunt resistance as tabulated in Table 6.1. The typical con- ditions assumed are closer to what we get in normal routine of cell fabrication. In the given table, the actual reﬂectance means actual measured reﬂectance from light trapping structures with samples having 80 nm silicon nitride (SiNx) based anti-reﬂection coating (ARC) on non-textured surface and on textured surface having 58 lm upright pyramids as shown in Fig. 6.1. The schematic of device under consideration can be seen from Fig. 6.2 for case of anti-reﬂection coating (ARC) on non-textured surface and on textured surface where both side surfaces are assumed textured. The simulated data in the two cases, i.e., ARC on non-textured surface case and textured surface case, would help in understanding the role of anti-reﬂection layer on cell performance enhancement. Also, cells other relevant parameters and their contribution can be tracked which might be contributing in the cell performance improvement when simulated electrical performance comparison is done for a typical and a best device having similar reﬂection proﬁle. Here, typical Fig. 6.1 Reﬂectance from surface of a 180 lm c-Si wafer having silicon nitride (SiNx) based anti-reﬂection coating on non-textured surface and textured surface 100 6 Anti-reﬂection Coatings with Textured Surface  and best device term is used to distinguish the material/semiconductor parameters difference in the simulation. The simulated IV characteristics can be seen from Fig. 6.3 which clearly indicate the improvement for combination of both light trapping structures, i.e., textured surface coated with dielectric ARC layer. Also to notice that the cell with best cell scenario parameters generate more current compared to typical cell Table 6.1 Simulation parameters for PC1D simulation in best cell scenario and typical cell scenario Solar cell parameters Best cell scenario Typical cell scenario Cell/Wafer thickness 180 lm 180 lm Cell active area 100 cm2 100 cm2 P-type base wafer resistivity 1 Ω-cm 1 Ω-cm Emitter sheet resistance (after doping) 50 Ω/sq (Diffusion proﬁle: erfc) 50 Ω/sq (Diffusion proﬁle: erfc) Junction depth 400 nm 400 nm Bulk recombination lifetime 400 ls 40 ls Front surface recombination velocity 100 cm/s 104 cm/s Back surface recombination velocity 100 cm/s 1000 cm/s Temperature 300 K 300 K Series resistance 1 mili-Ω 5 mili-Ω Shunt resistance 1000 Ω 100 Ω Reﬂectance proﬁle Actual reﬂectance Actual reﬂectance Light source One Sun, AM 1.5G spectrum One Sun, AM 1.5G spectrum Light intensity 100 mW/cm2 100 mW/cm2 Fig. 6.2 Schematic of solar cell a having anti-reﬂection coating (ARC) on non-textured surface and b ARC coating on textured surface (both side textured) (Texture size and individual layer thicknesses are for representation purpose and not to scale) 6.1 Primary Beneﬁt of Textured Surface in Combination  101 scenario parameters though the reﬂection proﬁle is same. Note that in the simu- lation, no parasitic absorption has been assumed. Also, for textured surface and non-textured surface based cell performance comparison in each scenario, similar surface recombination velocity has been assumed for particular case though the textured surface would generally lead high recombination velocity compared to planner surface. This shows the comparison of the cell performance improvements due to anti-reﬂection and light trapping improvement in cell solely, as all other parameters were kept constant. Table 6.2 gives PC1D-simulated cell performance parameters for textured and non-textured surface with ARC for both best cell scenario and typical cell scenario. The data indicates that there is gain in short circuit current (Jsc) of up to 3.23.5 mA/cm2 for the case of ARC on textured surface as compared to the case of ARC on non-textured surface. You can also notice from Table 6.2 that there is major improvement in open circuit voltage (Voc) when device parameters are selected for best cell scenario, however, impact on Jsc is relatively less. Also, the textured surface lead to lower Voc Fig. 6.3 Simulated IV characteristics of solar cell device having ARC coating on non-textured surface and textured surface for best cell scenario and typical cell scenario parameters Table 6.2 Cell performance parameters as per PC1D simulation Cell Open circuit voltage (Voc) (mV) Short circuit current (Jsc) (mA) Efﬁciency (η) (%) Non-textured + SiNx ARC (Best cell scenario) 660.4 35.8 19.7 Textured + SiNx ARC (Best cell scenario) 646.6 39.3 21.1 Non-textured + SiNx ARC (Typical cell scenario) 623.4 34.3 17.2 Textured + SiNx ARC (Typical cell scenario) 618.8 37.5 18.6 102 6 Anti-reﬂection Coatings with Textured Surface  due to increased defect states on surface because of increased (111) crystal plane area as discussed in Sect. 5.2 of previous chapter. It is worth mentioning that the defect states increment due to texturing and exposure of more (111) plane on the surface is well accounted in PC1D during simulation and the impact can be seen in the simulated results. 6.2 Analysis on Cell Performance Having Textured Surface but Without and with Anti-reﬂection Layer In the above section, we saw the impact on solar cell performance for ARC layer in combination of texture surface and ARC layer in combination of non-texture sur- face. Now let us see what would be expected gain in solar cell performance when it is compared for light trapping structure having textured surface in combination of ARC layer and texture surface alone. The schematic of device can be seen from Fig. 6.4a for case of textured surface as sole light trapping structure and Fig. 6.4b for anti-reﬂection coating (ARC) in combination of textured surface. From Fig. 6.5, which shows the reﬂection from a 180 lm c-Si wafer having 80 nm silicon nitride (SiNx) based anti-reﬂection coating (ARC) on textured surface and from textured wafer surface, signiﬁcant reduction in reﬂectance for broad wavelength range can be noticed. Now, if this reﬂectance data is used for PC1D simulation, we would get to know how much relative improvement we are expecting in solar cell perfor- mance when adding anti-reﬂection layer (ARC) to a textured surface. For com- parisons, let us again assume two scenarios, i.e., best cell scenario and typical cell scenario as assumed in above section. In both cases, let us assume the 180 lm cell thickness of cell and 100 cm2cell active area. Fig. 6.4 Schematic of solar cell a having textured surface as sole light trapping structure; b having combination of anti-reﬂection coating (ARC) and textured surface for light trapping (Texture size and individual layer thicknesses are for representation purpose and not to scale) 6.1 Primary Beneﬁt of Textured Surface in Combination  103 Further, base wafer as p-type having resistivity 1 Ω-cm and diffused n-type emitter with sheet resistance 50 Ω/sq having erfc diffusion proﬁle is assumed. Also, it is assumed that the junction depth is 400 nm. AM 1.5G spectrum with intensity 100 mW/cm2 is taken for IV simulation. Simulation parameters used to obtain Fig. 6.5 are summarized in Table 6.1. Figure 6.6 shows the simulated IV char- acteristics which indicate the signiﬁcant improvement for combination of both light trapping structures, i.e., textured surface coated with dielectric ARC layer. Again, notice that in the cell with best cell scenario parameters more current gets generated as compared to typical cell scenario though the same reﬂection proﬁle is assumed in both cases. Cell performance parameters as per PC1D sim- ulation has been tabulated in Table 6.3. The data analysis indicates that there is expectation of gain in short circuit current (Jsc) of up to 3.43.6 mA/cm2 for tex- tured based surface in combination to ARC when compared with non-ARC coated textured surface. You can also notice from Table 6.3 that there is slight improve- ment in open circuit voltage (Voc) which is due to improved Jsc. Fig. 6.5 Reﬂectance from surface of a 180 lm c-Si wafer having KOH-IPA based textured surface and KOH-IPA based textured surface coated with silicon nitride (SiNx) based anti-reﬂection coating Fig. 6.6 Simulated IV characteristics of solar cell device with and without ARC coating on textured surface in two cell conditions (Best and Typical) 104 6 Anti-reﬂection Coatings with Textured Surface  Note that here we talked about the sole expected gain due to anti-reﬂection improvement. The assumption for particular cell scenario, in a given case, the surface recombination velocities (SRV) are same and dielectric ARC coating does not inﬂuence the surface passivation, is hypothetical. However, in actual case there is always improvement in SRV which adds up to the relative performance posi- tively for case of texture surface coated with dielectric ARC. The improvement in SRV due to dielectric ARC coating reﬂects the dual role of dielectric ARCs, i.e., improved anti-reﬂection and improved surface passivation. Analysis and discussion on dual role of dielectric ARCs and solar cell performance is done in next section. 6.3 Dual Role of Anti-reﬂection Layers in c-Si Solar Cells Till now we discussed about how improving the anti-reﬂection enhances the solar cell performance, especially short circuit current. Dielectric layer/anti-reﬂection coating (ARC) in combination with textured surface gives best performance mostly due to much better light trapping. Also, the ARC improves the passivation from the surface as it helps in saturating the dangling bonds present on c-Si wafer surface due to abrupt termination of atoms as discussed in Sect. 3.5 of Chap. 3. For comparison of current enhancement in above sections, the surface recom- bination velocities (SRVs) were assumed same in each scenario for cells with and without ARC-coated textured surfaces. However, if the textured surface is not coated with dielectric passivation layer, the front surface recombination velocity (FSRV) would be in the range of 106107 cm/s. Using well-optimized dielectric layer on such texture surface may improve the FSRV to 1001000 cm/s. Let us see how improvement in FSRV due to dielectric passivation layer impacts the cell performance. For this, let us again assume the cell thickness and cell active area same as assumed in Sect. 6.2. Also, the same kind of base wafer, i.e., p-type having resistivity 1 Ω-cm and diffused n-type emitter with sheet resistance 50 Ω/sq having erfc diffusion proﬁle with the junction depth of about 400 nm. The light source as per AM 1.5G spectrum with intensity 100 mW/cm2. For IQE, let us assume the Table 6.3 Cell performance parameters as per PC1D simulation Cell Open circuit voltage (Voc) (mV) Short circuit current (Jsc) (mA) Efﬁciency (η) (%) Textured but without ARC (Best) 644.1 35.7 19.1 Textured + SiNxARC (Best) 646.6 39.3 21.1 Textured but without ARC (Typical) 616.3 34.1 16.9 Textured + SiNxARC (Typical) 618.8 37.5 18.6 6.2 Analysis on Cell Performance Having Textured Surface  105 light intensity for simulation is 1 mW/cm2. The required simulation parameters for simulating solar cell performance and IQE with actual reﬂectance proﬁle (see Fig. 6.5) has been tabulated in Table 6.4. For comparative analysis, let us assume that the dielectric ARC coating improves the FSRV from 106 to 1000 cm/s. The improved FSRV specially inﬂuences the collection of charge carriers gen- erated due to short wavelengths. As the FSRV improves, internal quantum efﬁ- ciency (IQE) improves at shorter wavelength range as you can see in Fig. 6.7 which shows the simulated IQE for the two cases. Clear improvement can be seen in short wavelength range (300500 nm) for cell with better FSRV. The cell performance parameters tabulated in Table 6.5 also indicate the difference of improved FSRV which mainly inﬂuences the open-circuit voltage (Voc) of the cell. The short-circuit current gain is mainly due to improved anti-reﬂection when textured surface is coated with dielectric layer. So, the dual role of such dielectric layer which improves anti-reﬂection leading to improved short circuit current, and improving surface passivation and hence FSRV leading to improved open circuit voltage, can be understood from this analysis. Improved charge carrier collection especially in short wavelength region adds up to the current collection from the solar cell device leading to overall performance improvement.

In those discussed cases, improved light trapping contribution is seen mainly in enhancing the current gen- eration potential of the cell. Also, improved surface passivation by dielectric coating improves current collection and open-circuit voltage from the cell. We also have seen in Chap. 4 that there are many types of texture-based light trapping structures which with combination of appropriate ARC can lead to better perfor- mance. But, cost effectiveness is the deciding factor in implementation and adop- tion of these light trapping structures for large-scale solar cell production. The upright pyramid based light trapping structure in combination with optimized dielectric coating is simpler and scalable to industrial production level and is a widely preferred light trapping technology. However, the inverted pyramids based light trapping would be better compared to upright pyramids based light trapping structure as discussed in Sect. 4.5 of Chap. 4. Best reported cell in mono c-Si solar category had inverted pyramid based light trapping structure coated with double dielectric layer (Zhao et al. 1996). But to form inverted pyramid structure, Table 6.5 Cell performance parameters as per PC1D simulation Cell Open circuit voltage (Voc) (mV) Short circuit current (Jsc) (mA) Efﬁciency (η) (%) Cell with textured surface and No ARC 598.9 32.6 15.6 Cell with textured surface and with ARC 619.7 37.6 18.7 Fig. 6.7 Simulated IQE characteristics of solar cell device with and without ARC coating on textured surface 6.4 Most Suitable Light Trapping Geometry 107 lithography technique is required as discussed in Sect. 5.3 of Chap. 5. So, though the inverted pyramid based light trapping structure may provide comparatively better light trapping, due to cost effectiveness as well as comparative implemen- tation simplicity, chemical texturing based upright pyramidal light trapping struc- ture is preferred in mono c-Si wafer based solar cell manufacturing line. A typical cell schematic which is well-preferred device structure for p-type mono c-Si solar cell is shown in Fig. 6.8. The shown p-type mono c-Si solar cell in the ﬁgure has upright pyramid based textured surface at both front and back surface and front surface is coated with dielectric layer which acts as surface passivation layer as well as anti-reﬂection coating. The back surface is passivated by back surface ﬁeld (BSF) formed during contact ﬁring of the cell where highly doped region are formed at metal (back contact)-Si interface as discussed in Chap. 2. In multi c-Si solar cells, where the upright pyramid structures are not possible for large area processing and is not preferred as suitable texture structure, honeycomb structures are used which are fabricated by chemical isotropic etching as discussed in Chap. 5.

The cell geometries remain the same as mono c-Si solar cell except the substrate wafer which is multi-crystalline instead of (100) mono crystalline. 6.5 Implication of Existing Light Trapping Geometry for Next Generation Solar Cells All the discussions are made for different light trapping structures until now indicated that having combination of texture and ARC-coated surfaces would result in better performing cells. All these analysis are true and well appreciated considering the fact that still we are using commonly available wafer thickness of 180200 lm. However, when we talk about further cost reduction in solar cell manufacturing, wafer thickness used in solar cell fabrication should decrease to bring down the uses of Si material to reduce cost proportion shared by wafer in cell price as discussed in Chap. 2. Thinner wafer based solar cell would be preferred in near future and lots of efforts are being put to manufacture cost effective thinner c-Si wafers at industrial scale. When the current c-Si solar cell technology would be shifting towards thin (100 lm) wafer based technology, light trapping using textured and ARC com- bination based technology would be a concern and may not be favorable. Such light trapping geometry in thinner wafer based cells would result in relatively more surface recombination due to roughening of the surface. The surface roughening result in relative increment of (111) plane based surface compared to planner surface having (100) plane considering pyramidal textures. A study presented by McIntosh et al. (McIntosh and Johnson 2009) indicates that when (100) Si wafer is textured, surface area covered with (111) planes on surface increases and the sur- face area increase is about 1.73 times or more when compared with planner (100) wafer surface. This increased surfaces area with more (111) planes have more dangling bonds and trap states which would lead to more recombination events at the surface. McIntosh et al. (McIntosh and Johnson 2009) did comparative study for recombination increment between Si wafers having planner surface and textured surface. They used a 400 lm thick and (100) ﬂoat-zoned n-type silicon wafers with resistivity  100 Ω-cm. After texturing, their sample had 1.52 lm random pyramids. Their planner and textured surface based samples had been subjected to light POCl3 diffusion (both sides) with post-processing sheet resistance of 130160 Ω/sq and passivated using thermally grown oxide. The measured effective lifetime using photo conductance method for the two cases and the observed results are shown in Fig. 6.10. The effective lifetime for random textured silicon wafer sample show signiﬁ- cantly shorter lifetime compared to planner (100) Si sample. Increased recombi- nation, up to 1012 times for random textured surface when compared with planner (100) surface, is indicated. Also, for non-diffused Si with textured surface and passivated with PECVD SiNx, many researcher have shown up to 35 times 6.4 Most Suitable Light Trapping Geometry 109 increment in recombination when compared to planner Si surface processed under same condition. Such increment in surface recombination which impacts the minority carrier life time (s) adversely is matter of concern, especially when our target is thin c-Si wafer based cells. Minority carrier lifetime (s) is most important parameter for cell electrical performance point of view and larger value s is pre- ferred for fabricating an efﬁcient solar cell. Relative reduction in minority carrier lifetime due to increased recombination at surface is the major downside of the traditional texturization based light trapping structure. Impact on minority carrier lifetime becomes much more critical as the thickness of wafer is reduced further. The high recombination probability in small thickness wafers, where more charge carrier generation happen in relatively smaller volume, the surface recombination effect becomes much more prominent. The texturization process leading to rela- tively higher surface recombination would require extremely good surface passi- vation as the wafer thickness reduces. Let us point out here that c-Si solar cells with good efﬁciency has also been reported using thinner c-Si wafer having textured surface, e.g., heterojunction with intrinsic thin-layer (HIT) cells as discussed in Sect. 2.7 of Chap. 2. However, there is no comparison that exists at present for relative performance improvement if the same cells are fabricated avoiding tex- turization step. Also, if some light trapping structure comes as alternative to tex- turization with similar light trapping potential, these cells may even perform better due to relatively improved minority carrier lifetime. 6.6 Suitable Light Trapping Structure for Next Generation Solar Cells Next generation c-Si solar cells would be based on thinner wafers and light man- agement in such low thickness wafer based cells would be challenging. The main implication of textured surface based light trapping structure in combination of suitable anti-reﬂection coating (ARC) is increase in surface recombination which Fig. 6.10 Effective lifetime as a function of excess carrier concentration for rantex (random textured) and planar (100) wafer based samples (Reproduced from (McIntosh and Johnson 2009), with permission of AIP Publishing) 110 6 Anti-reﬂection Coatings with Textured Surface  adversely impacts the solar cell performance. Also, texturing process requires etching of Si material and usually 510 lm texture surface requires about 510 lm etching of Si wafer from each side, which is really signiﬁcant for next generation thin c-Si solar cell technology where target wafer thickness is  100 lm for solar cell manufacturing. In such scenario, the requirement of better light trapping arrangement becomes essential so that we can target better light trapping as well as lower loss of active absorbing material. The suitability of alternative light trapping structure would be decided by its potential to increase the cell performance in competence with texture and ARC combination based light trapping structures. As discussed in Sect. 6.1, for ARC on textures surface when compared with ARC on planner surface, there is scope of 3.23.5 mA/cm2 current enhancement (see Table 6.2). Whereas reduction in open circuit voltage due to increased recombi- nation (SRV) at surface because of surface roughening is evident. The analysis made in Sect. 6.1 was for 180200 lm thick c-Si wafer based cells. However, more suitable light trapping structure for next generation c-Si solar cells would be one for which we could make similar enhancement in current even if the thickness of wafer used for the cell fabrication is reduced to  100 lm. If somehow the light trapping structure does not take part in active device (i.e., where the actual light absorption and the charge carrier generation and recombination happens) and do not inﬂuence the surface passivation adversely as textured structure, degradation in Voccan also be avoided and overall enhancements in cell performance can be expected. Also, it is worth mentioning here that as the thickness of wafer reduces, the enhancement in Voc can be expected provided the surface recombination velocity tends to zero, i.e., if excellent surface passivation could be achieved. The thickness of solar cell and open circuit voltage are related as per following given Eq. (6.1) provided the wafer thickness (W)  minority carrier diffusion length (L) (Brendel and Queisser 1993). dVoc dW ¼  kT q  1 W ; ð6:1Þ where k is Boltzmann constant, q is charge of electron, T is temperature of the cell. So, for moving towards next generation c-Si solar cells, we would need such light trapping structure which should not be the part of active device, i.e., no surface modiﬁcation for light trapping should be associated with active absorbing material which might lead to increased recombination. And yet it should provide competi- tive light trapping when compared to ARC-coated textured surface based light trapping structure. Schematic of solar cells with current and indicative next gen- eration light trapping structure, which indicates the expected shift in device architecture design, is shown in Fig. 6.11. Figure 6.11a shows schematic of a c-Si solar cell architecture currently in use having ARC coated textured surface at front and have both side surface textured. Also, a probable next generation thinner c-Si wafer based solar cell schematic is shown in Fig. 6.11b which has an indicative alternative light trapping structure as replacement of texturization-based light trapping geometry and where both front and back surfaces are planner. It indicates 6.6 Suitable Light Trapping Structure for Next Generation Solar Cells 111 no surface modiﬁcation for light trapping to avoid increment in surface recombination. Here discussion on alternative light trapping structure has been made as replacement of textured surface. However, it is worth pointing out here that thinner c-Si solar cells with textured surface coated with ARC has also been reported. For example, 18 lm thin c-Si solar cell on steel substrate (Wang et al. 2014) and 47 lm thin c-Si solar cell with PERL structure (Wang and Zhao 1996) by Wang et al. Also, 43 lm thin c-Si solar cell by Petermann et al. (2012). All these cells were reported to give short circuit current in the range of 3437.8 mA/cm2 with opti- mized structures. But, comparison to relative performance improvement for the same cells fabricated avoiding texturization step does not exist and the impact of texturization and relative gain or loss in Voc and Jsc of the cell cannot be com- mented for such thin c-Si wafer based cells. Alternative light trapping structures with similar light trapping potential may lead to better cell performance due to relatively lower recombination at surface. Some advancement in alternative light trapping geometries as alterative to texturization-based light trapping structures has been discussed in subsequent chapters. 6.7 Questions and Problems 1.

In this chapter, the discussion have been made mainly on the advancement in traditional light trapping e.g. development and techniques for nano-sized textures, back reﬂectors and the cell designs incorporating the latest developments. Interference lithography technique for nano-sized inverted pyramids based in c-Si solar cell has been discussed. Also, brief introduction to nanoparticles based back reﬂectors as well as plasmonics based light director and related developments and scopes has been discussed. 7.1 Traditional Light-Trapping Structures Traditional light-trapping structure means the light-trapping structure which is widely in use currently for manufacturing c-Si solar cells where c-Si wafers of thickness in the range of 180200 lm is used. The widely used light trapping structure in c-Si solar cells is pyramidal texture in combination with anti-reﬂection coating. In pyramidal texture-based light trapping, upright pyramids at both the surfaces of the cell, as shown in Fig. 7.1a, is the most widely used. In such design, the front texture is coated with anti-reﬂection coating, usually with silicon nitride (SiNx) thin ﬁlm, for enhanced forward coupling of light and better cell performance as dis- cussed in pervious chapter. Also, the front surface has ﬁngers and bus bars for contact. For the back contact, the complete surface at back is covered with metal which also provides better back reﬂection from the surface. The other light trapping geometry is inverted pyramid texture in combination with anti-reﬂection coating as shown in Fig. 7.1b. In such design, all other layers, like front contact, back contact, and anti-reﬂection coating thickness, remains the same expect the texture shape at both sides of the cell. As discussed in the previous chapter, cells having such inverted pyramidal textures on surface, gives better cell performance compared to upright pyramidal textures.  Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017 C.S. Solanki and H.K. Singh, Anti-reﬂection and Light Trapping in c-Si Solar Cells, Green Energy and Technology, DOI 10.1007/978-981-10-4771-8_7 115 In multi-c-Si solar cells, since pyramidal texture is not possible due to different grain sizes having different orientations of crystal plane, isotropic etching-based honeycomb-like structures in combination of anti-reﬂection coating are used as shown in Fig. 7.1c. In this case also, other layers, like front contact, back contact, and anti-reﬂection coating thickness, are similar as in pyramidal texture based mono c-Si solar cells expect the texture shape at both side. In all the above-mentioned cases of traditional light-trapping structures, where 180200 lm c-Si wafers are used, the texture dimension lies in the range of 510 lm. In order to achieve the texture dimension of 510 lm, usually the loss of thickness from each side is in order of 1015 lm. In efforts to reduce the cell manufacturing cost, ways for manufacturing thinner c-Si wafers are being explored. Now, if the thickness of wafer would reduce, 5 10 lm texture dimension currently used for light trapping may not be favorable as it would lead to increased surface to volume ratio and higher surface recombination. A representative schematic of texture surface proportion and its dominance in surface to volume ratio can be visualized from Fig. 7.2. Figure 7.2a represents a 180200 lm wafer with larger size dimension and Fig. 7.2b represents  100 lm wafer with larger size dimension. Here, larger size dimension refers to 510 lm pyramid shape textures. You can clearly distinguish the relative proportion of texture surface in representative thinner wafer. Processing such 510 lm texture surface in  100 lm wafers would not only lead to more surface recombination as (c) Honeycomb like structure Mono c-Si solar cell (180-200 μm) Upright pyramid Inverted pyramid (b) (a) Mono c-Si solar cell (180-200 μm) MulƟ c-Si solar cell (180-200 μm) Back contact Back contact Front contact Front contact Fig. 7.1 Schematic of mono c-Si wafer-based solar cell having a upright pyramid-based texture at both side and anti-reﬂection coating on front; b inverted pyramid-based texture at both side and anti-reﬂection coating on front; c multi c-Si wafer-based solar cell having honeycomb-like texture at both side and anti-reﬂection coating at front 116 7 Advancements in Traditional Light Trapping Structures discussed in previous chapter, but also would increase the comparative material loss proportion in texturing. For example, assume that for making 510 lm texture surfaces, the texturization process etches the wafer by 15 lm from each size. It would mean a total of 30 lm of wafer material loss. For 200 lm wafer, it would account approximately 15% material loss. However, when you do the calculation for 100 lm thick wafer, this proportional loss would become about 30%, which is signiﬁcant. One solution may be use of smaller dimension (few nanometer to  1 lm) based texture surfaces for obtaining good light trapping in thinner c-Si-based solar cells and many researchers are also exploring in this direction. There has been recent developments where alternative processing techniques are explored to fab- ricate nano-texture shapes (  1 lm) which may be suitable for thin c-Si wafers-based cells (Mavrokefalos et al. 2012; Sivasubramaniam and Alkaisi 2014; Liu et al. 2015). Such nano-sized texture shapes on thinner c-Si wafers, as represented in Fig. 7.3, with good light-trapping capability would help in lowering c-Si wafer (180-200 μm) Randomly textured surface (5-10 μm) c-Si wafer (  100 μm) (b) (a) Fig. 7.2 Schematics of textures shapes on surface a having larger size textures (say 510 lm size) on 180200 lm wafer; b having larger size (say 510 lm size) textures on  100 lm wafer c-Si wafer (  100 μm) Randomly textured surface ( 1 μm) Fig. 7.3 Schematics of textures shapes on surface having smaller size texture on  100 lm wafer 7.1 Traditional Light-Trapping Structures 117 the surface recombination as well as in minimization of the material loss in etching process. More about developments in fabrication of nano-sized pyramidal textures on c-Si surfaces has been covered in the following section. 7.2 Inverted Pyramid-Based Light Trapping for Thin Wafer-Based Cells In pyramidal texture-based light-trapping scheme, inverted pyramids are better as compared to upright pyramid-based light-trapping structure. As discussed in the above section, for thinner c-Si solar cells, it is necessary to avoid large size textures as well as material losses. With technology development, now it is possible to fabricate inverted pyramids of nano sizes with good light trapping potential. As discussed in Sect. 5.3 of Chap. 5, using interference lithography with anisotropic etching method, inverted pyramids on c-Si wafer can be fabricated. This technique allows us to fabricate nanoscale-inverted pyramids for light trapping provided the lithography system has high resolution and capability to form interference pattern on photoresist at nanoscale dimension. For example, Mavrokefalos et al. (2012) fabricated scalable nano-sized-inverted pyramids on SOI (Si on insulator) wafers using interference lithography with the help of negative photoresist and subsequent KOH-based anisotropic etching. The inverted pyramids of sizes smaller than 1 lm with spacing between successive inverted pyramids of about 100  10 nm has been demonstrated. The SEM image of the fabricated sample is given in Fig. 7.4. In recent development, Liu et al. (2015) presented Cesium Chloride (CsCl)- based self-assembled lithography for nanoscale-inverted pyramid fabrication on c-Si wafers. In this technique, ﬁrst CsCl thin ﬁlm is deposited on c-Si wafer and annealed to form CsCl nano island as shown in Fig. 7.5. After CsCl nano island 1 μm Fig. 7.4 SEM image (top view) of nano-sized inverted pyramids fabricated on SOI wafers using interference lithography (Reprinted with permission from Nano Lett, 12, Mavrokefalos A, Han SE, Yerci S, et al., Efﬁcient Light Trapping in Inverted Nanopyramid Thin Crystalline Silicon Membranes for Solar Cell Applications, 27922796, 2012, American Chemical Society) 118 7 Advancements in Traditional Light Trapping Structures formation, Titanium (Ti) thin ﬁlm is deposited on the substrate and latter the substrate is agitated with help of ultrasonication technique in deionized (DI) water for lift-off of Ti-coated CsCl islands. This process leaves only Ti on Si wafer with nanoporous Si surface. After ultrasonication step, when CsCl islands coated with Ti is lifted-off, the sample is subjected to NaOH/KOH + IPA-based anisotropic etching process as discussed in Chap. 5. At the end the process, sample is cleaned in HF and DI water solution for completely removing the Ti from Si surface and the samples are dried for further cell processing. Pyramid of size below 1 lm is possible with this technique. The SEM image of nanoscale-inverted pyramid using this technique by Liu et al. (2015) is shown in Fig. 7.6. The size and morphology of inverted pyramid in this method is governed by diameter of fabricated CsCl islands and etching time of the sample in alkaline solution. Liu et al. (2015) achieved less than 10% reﬂectance from Si wafer for 4001000 nm wavelength range with nanoscale- inverted pyramid structure using this technique. Here, it would be worth mentioning that the fabrication and implementation of such nano-sized inverted pyramids in thin c-Si wafer-based cell technology seems easy but it is not that easy.

Liu et al. 2015) 7.2 Inverted Pyramid-Based Light Trapping for Thin Wafer-Based Cells 119 would add to the cost of manufacturing of the cell. Especially, a process involving lithography has not been seen as cost effective process. So, one should also keep in mind while developing such effective technique for fabrication of light trapping structures that how such processes could be made less complicated and could be scaled up for implementation in the existing manufacturing line. 7.3 Back Reﬂectors for Enhanced Light Trapping In c-Si solar cells, the back surface is completely covered with metal which acts as back contact. Usually Aluminum (Al)/Silver (Ag) is used for back contact in c-Si solar cells which also acts as back reﬂector. Remember the discussion made in Chap. 4 about path length enhancement using different light trapping structures. Theoretically maximum path length enhancement would be 4n2 for case of Lambertian surface, if the back surface is perfectly reﬂecting. If the back surface is not perfectly reﬂecting, the path length enhancement would come down to 2n2, i.e., the light-trapping potential of light-trapping structure would be reduced by half. This establishes the signiﬁcance of back reﬂector in light trapping and cell performance. The back contact material used for c-Si solar cell should be such that it should make ohmic contact with Si material and at the same time it should be a perfect reﬂector, as it is clear that for better light trapping, both sides of the wafer should be textured while fabricating the cell. The back contact completely covers the textured surface at the back as it has been shown in Fig. 7.1. The textured surface helps in reﬂecting the weekly absorbing light from back surface at angle larger than critical angle and minimizes the escape of weekly absorbing light from front surface. Fig. 7.6 SEM image of nanoscale-inverted pyramid fabricated using CsCl based self-assembled lithography technique (Reprinted from Mater Sci Semicond Process, 40, Liu J, Zhang X, Sun G, et al., Fabrication of inverted pyramid structure by Cesium Chloride self-assembly lithography for silicon solar cell, 4449, 2015, with permission from Elsevier) 120 7 Advancements in Traditional Light Trapping Structures However, as we talk about cell fabrication using thinner wafers and avoiding roughening of the surface, we must have some alternate way to reﬂect the light back at larger angle. This can be done using nanostructures at surface as shown in Fig. 7.7 where nanoparticles of metals or dielectrics can be used between Si and back contact interface at back surface. In such scenario, enhanced light trapping can be expected without texturing the back surface, i.e., only one side of surface tex- turing would be required. In this direction, there have been some recent developments where researchers have tried to use nanostructure made of metals or dielectrics at back side of the cell and have reported some positive results. For example, Eisenlohr et al. (2015) explored the light-trapping enhancement in c-Si solar cell using silicon oxide (SiO2)- based dielectric spheres at back as shown in Fig. 7.8a. A thin tunnel passivating layer is also used to electrically separate the dielectric spheres from cells base. Such structure by Eisenlohr et al. (2015) indicated better absorption of light for wave- lengths above 1050 nm. The enhancement in absorption was equivalent to 0.4 mA/cm2 current. Please note that in this case the device was having front surface textured and rear surface planer in combination with dielectric spheres having diameter approximately 1000 nm. This enhancement was in comparison to device having front surface textured and rear surface planer, without dielectric spheres. The relative enhancement in absorption is shown in Fig. 7.8b. Also, for the case where the device was having front surface planer and rear surface planer in combination with dielectric spheres, showed absorption enhancement equivalent to 1.6 mA/cm2, when compared with device having front and rear both surfaces planer. Similar approach has also been explored by Yang et al. (2012) where silver nanoparticles were tested at back surface for enhancing the trapping of weakly absorbed infrared light in PERT (Passivated Emitter and Rear Totally Diffused) cell conﬁguration. Rear structure corresponding to a standard PERT cell with silver nanoparticle combination is shown in Fig. 7.9. In Fig. 7.9b, SiO2 layer not only Back contact c-Si solar cell Metal/Dielectric nanostructure Light Fig. 7.7 Schematic of nanostructures-based back scattering of light in combination with back contact based back reﬂector 7.3 Back Reﬂectors for Enhanced Light Trapping 121 passivates the rear surface but also provide isolation to silver nanoparticles from the cell. Yang et al. (2012) showed optical path length enhancement (Z) of about 10.05  3.9 for light having wavelength 1200 nm using silver nanoparticles in zinc sulﬁde (ZnS) and magnesium ﬂuoride (MgF2) matrix at back with evaporated Al-based back contact for cells having PERT structure. Metal or dielectric nanostructures which provide backscattering of light similar to texture surface at back utilizes Mie scattering effect. The backscattering capability of Mie scattering is governed by nanostructure dimension, spacer layer thickness, nanostructure and medium dielectric constants, etc. More about Mie scattering and back reﬂection from nanostructures is covered in next chapter.

There is projection that the next-generation c-Si solar cells would be fabricated using much thinner wafers (  100 lm). The light-trapping methodologies dis- cussed till now were focused on surface roughening of the wafer which was introduced by Haynos et al. (1974) in 1974. Since then it has been main stream light-trapping technology for c-Si solar cells. Now, when moving ahead and pro- gressing toward the use of thinner wafer for the cell fabrication, texturization process of surface, which leads to increased surface recombination and absorbing material loss as discussed in above sections, would be not a favorable option. In view of this, nano-sized-inverted pyramid textures have been introduced which might result relatively lesser surface recombination and lower material loss during etching process. However, such technique still roughens the surface and there is probability that it would still impact the minority carrier life time in thinner c-Si wafers. Also, fabrication of nano-sized-inverted pyramidal textures, as discussed in above section, uses lithographic technique which is additional process and its processing cost adds up in the cost of the cell fabrication. Therefore there is need to introduce alternative light trapping scheme, which is not based on texturization or surface roughening but provides light trapping similar to texturization-based tech- nology, which is needed for next-generation thin c-Si solar technology. Such requirement brings in the concept of light directors. Light directors can be high refractive index-based nanostructures which can forward scatter or couple the incident light toward active absorbing material as shown in Fig. 7.10. Such designs, if implemented on the surface of c-Si solar cells, would help in avoiding surface roughening process for light trapping. And hence, it would help in lowering the surface recombination and would allow us to minimize material loss which happens during etching process. Such light directors in combination with optimized anti-reﬂectors at planner surface can substitute the texturization step in c-Si solar cell c-Si solar cell Light Light Light Director (b) (a) Fig. 7.10 Schematic of a scattering-based light directors which scatter the incident light toward the active absorbing material of c-Si solar cell at larger angle; b forward coupling-based light directors which couple the incident light into the active absorbing material of c-Si solar cell 7.4 Advanced Light-Trapping Structures for Next-Generation c-Si Solar Cells 123 c-Si solar cell fabrication. There has been many developments in this direction recently where researchers have tried to explore metal nanoparticles (Pillai and Green 2010; Green and Pillai 2012), dielectric gratings (Zhou et al. 2010; Brongersma et al. 2014), combination of metal and dielectric nanostructures (Singh et al. 2016) for enhanced light trapping in solar cells. The target for such light-trapping structure development is to achieve broadband reﬂection minimiza- tion, in the wavelength range of 3001200 nm, which is most suitable for c-Si solar cells. For wide acceptance of such trapping structures, it should be cost effective and easy to implement in thin c-Si wafer-based solar cell fabrication technology. Light directors based on nanostructure of metal/dielectric materials utilize plas- monics technology or Mie scattering phenomenon during lightmatter interaction and provide capability to control light propagation at nanoscale. More about Mie scattering and plasmonic-based lightmatter interaction for enhanced light trapping in c-Si solar cells is covered in subsequent chapters. 7.5 Questions and Problems 1.

Historical developments in the area of plas- monics and the review on applicability of plasmonic-based light-trapping tech- nology in solar cells have been presented. Also, a broad overview on physics of light trapping using plasmonic-based nanostructures has been covered. Relevant light-trapping techniques such as scattering, local ﬁeld enhancement, and surface plasmon polariton (SPP) has been discussed along with the associated mechanism involved for efﬁcient light trapping. Also, widely used Mie scattering theory and the mathematical solutions to calculate Mie efﬁciencies for different size, shape, dielectric medium-based nanostructures has been covered. Towards the end of the chapter, discussion on better metal/material choice for plasmonic-based light-trapping applications has been done. 8.1 Plasmonics: Historical Development Plasmonics is a ﬁeld of study where photon-electron cloud-based electromagnetic interaction is studied. It enables us to understand the interaction of light and free electrons in matter, especially in metals. It has been subject of interest since many years due to its applicability and usefulness in different applications. 8.1.1 Plasmon and Surface Plasmon Effect Plasmon term was ﬁrst introduced by David Pines in 1956 (Hubenthal 2011) which was meant for collective oscillation of the free electron gas density. This term was adopted for surface plasmon resonance in later years. As the conduction electrons in metal nanoparticles/nanostructures do the movement due to excitation by incident  Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017 C.S. Solanki and H.K. Singh, Anti-reﬂection and Light Trapping in c-Si Solar Cells, Green Energy and Technology, DOI 10.1007/978-981-10-4771-8_8 127 radiation, they behave like electron gas and lead to build up of polarization charges on the particle surface as shown in Fig. 8.1. These polarization charges are the result of particles/nanostructure electrons displacement from equilibrium due to incident electromagnetic (EM) radiation electric ﬁeld. The conduction electron acceleration by the incident radiations electric ﬁeld induces the polarization in both, the particle and surrounding medium. The restoring force due to polarization charges leads to conﬁnement of the electrons to dimensions smaller than the wavelength of light which is responsible for surface plasmon effect, i.e., oscillatory motion of the electrons with a characteristic fre- quency (Evanoff and Chumanov 2005). Such restoring forces, which results in oscillatory motion of the electrons with a characteristic frequency, lead to the concept of surface plasmons, where the characteristic frequency is known as surface plasmons frequency. Note that the polarization is induced in the surrounding medium because the oscillating electrons are in opposite direction. This in return reduces the restoring force for the electrons and leads to shifting of the surface plasmon frequency to a lower frequency (Evanoff and Chumanov 2005). Thus frequency corresponding to the plasmon resonance can be ﬁne-tuned to desired frequency by controlling the dielectric constant of the surrounding medium. This kind of control and lightmatter interaction at nanoscale dimension opens up avenues for its application in various ﬁelds. 8.1.2 Historical Presence and Development Plasmonic-based technology is currently an area of interest in different application- oriented developments like biomedical sensors, metamaterials, LEDs, drug delivery, cancer diagnosis, etc. It has also been actively explored and exploited in past, either knowingly or unknowingly, in different areas and applications like medicine, architecture, painting, biotechnology, etc. In early days, the development and application-oriented possibilities of plasmonic-based technology were depen- dent on the ability to synthesize/fabricate nanostructures of various materials with different sizes and shapes. Atomic cores (+ve) Electron clouds (-ve) Incident light Reflected light Fig. 8.1 Schematic of polarization effect due to movement of conduction electrons by incident light excitation where atomic cores are positively charged and conduction electrons at particle surface behave like electron cloud which are negatively charged 128 8 Plasmonic-Based Advanced Anti-reﬂection  First example of plasmonic-based technology is Roman Lycurgus Cup, which dates to the fourth century AD (Evanoff and Chumanov 2005; Garcia 2011). It is a bronze cup lined with colored glass. As per Evanoff and Chumanov (2005), the glass scatters a dull green light and transmits red light. The glass contains 70 nm particles, which are an alloy of silver (70%) and gold (30%) as per study commissioned by the British Museum. In fourth century AD, it would have not been known that why such shift in scattered light wavelength occurs. The explanation to such beautiful scat- tering and lightnanostructure interaction came in twentieth century, when Gustav Mie published his work in 1908 on the extinction of light by metal spheres. Now, it is well known that such silver nanoparticles of this sizes scatters green light and transmit orange and how gold (Au) presence shifts the absorption band to longer wavelengths. This explains the observation made for Lycurgus Cup as why it scatters dull green light and transmits red light. In the past, small nanoparticles have been used to create stained glass with help of ruby red Au and lemon-yellow Ag nanoparticles. In 1850s, Michael Faraday con- ducted the ﬁrst notable scientiﬁc study of the optical properties of metal nanopar- ticles colloidal suspensions and ultra-thin metal ﬁlms (Evanoff and Chumanov 2005). He noticed the ability of extremely thin Au leaf to transmit green light and speculated that if a material is capable of strong interaction with light then it can also do strong interaction even if dimensions is smaller than visible wavelengths. The scattering phenomenon and optical responses of Au suspensions were explained by Gustav Mie, who studied the extinction of light by metal spheres. In his paper published in 1908, Mie had mathematically described the optical responses of Au suspensions (Evanoff and Chumanov 2005). Starting from the macroscopic Maxwell equations, Mie calculated the extinction, scattering, and absorption cross-sections of Au nanoparticles and showed how the spectra of the suspensions evolve as a function of particle size. The origin of the optical properties of metallic nanoparticles (NPs) was understood after Mies work in the early twentieth century. However, further exploitation was limited by the capabilities to synthesize and manipulate the nanoparticles in a controlled way (Garcia 2011). Surface plasmons and related application-oriented possibilities spread quickly in many ﬁelds toward the end of twentieth century when the era of nanotechnology started. 8.2 Plasmonics in Solar Cells Plasmonic-based light trapping has been explored in recent years for different types of solar cell technologies to improve the cell performance. Westphalen et al. (2000) explored this technology for photovoltaic conversion efﬁciency enhancement of an organic solar cell by incorporation of small metal clusters as shown in Fig. 8.2a. Nahm et al. (2011) explored such technology to show efﬁciency enhancement in die-sensitized solar cell where they used Au nanoparticles for improving light trapping in the cell as shown in Fig. 8.2b. 8.1 Plasmonics: Historical Development 129 Silver nanoparticles on front surface for Si-based solar cells (see Fig. 8.3) has also been explored for light-trapping enhancement where enhancement in light trapping and current generation potential of the cell near its active absorbing material (i.e., Si) band gap has been demonstrated (Pillai et al. 2007). There are various ways where metal nanoparticles can be used for enhancement in light-trapping capability of the cell and its performance. In a nice review paper, Atwater and Polman (2010) have discussed about different possible ways that plasmonic-based technology using metal nanostructures can be implemented for enhanced light trapping in active absorbing material of the solar cells. This include scattering, local ﬁeld enhancement, and surface plasmon polariton-based light-trapping technologies. Let us have a look on these techniques. Fig. 8.2 a Schematic of an organic solar cell structure where small metal clusters have been incorporated (Reprinted from Sol Energy Mater Sol Cells, 61, Westphalen M, Kreibig U, Rostalski J, et al., Metal cluster enhanced organic solar cells, 97105, 2000, with permission from Elsevier); b Schematic of TiO2-based dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), where Au nanoparticles are incorporated into TiO2 nanoparticles which helps to trap more light (Reproduced from [Nahm C, Choi H, Kim J, et al.

Si Buried oxide-1000 nm Si-1250 nm Silver islands Si Silver islands 30 nm top oxide Fig. 8.3 Schematic of Si-based cell structure where nanoparticles at front surface has been explored for light-trapping enhancement (after Ref. Pillai et al. 2007) 130 8 Plasmonic-Based Advanced Anti-reﬂection  8.2.1 Enhanced Light Trapping by Light Scattering Based on Particle Plasmons Using metallic nanoparticles as subwavelength scattering elements, light trapping can be enhanced. Metallic nanoparticles help in coupling the freely propagating electromagnetic radiation/light into an active absorbing material (Fig. 8.4a). In such technique, multiple and high-angle scattering result in trapping of light into the active absorbing material of the solar cell. In this method, high-angle scattering results in an increased effective optical path length in the absorbing material. Such technique, where the particles can be incorporated and implemented at the ﬁnal stage of device processing, is encouraging if it works for broad wavelength range. This light scattering-based technique would be more appropriate for implementa- tion in solar cells, where nanoparticles can be incorporated on surface without adversely impacting the other important parameters required for efﬁcient cell. c-Si wafer-based solar cell technology would be a good candidate for wavelength scattering-based light-trapping structure. 8.2.2 Enhanced Light Trapping by Particle Plasmons-Based Light Concentration In case of particle plasmons-based light concentration for enhanced light trapping, metallic nanoparticles/nanostructures are used with appropriate dimensions such that they act as subwavelength antennas. When light interacts with the metallic nanostructures, the plasmonic near-ﬁeld is coupled and in return it increases its effective absorption cross-section into the active absorbing material immediate to the nanostructure (Fig. 8.4b). The excited metallic structure near-ﬁeld helps in more light absorption and the creation of electronhole (eh) pairs in the absorbing material. Such light concentration-based arrangement works well but only with small metallic nanoparticles (520 nm diameter) for which the albedo (scattering cross-section over sum of scattering and absorption cross-sections) is low. This (a) (b) (c) Fig. 8.4 Plasmonic light-trapping geometries for enhanced light trapping a light scattering based on particle plasmons, b particle plasmons-based light concentration, c surface plasmon polariton (SPP)-based light trapping (after Ref. Atwater and Polman 2010) 8.2 Plasmonics in Solar Cells 131 technique would be useful in materials, where the carrier diffusion length is small. One important requirement of such arrangement is that the photo carriers must, thus, be generated close to the collection junction area. For metallic nanostructure-based antennas to have efﬁcient energy conversion effects, the absorption rate in the absorbing material must be larger than the reciprocal of the typical plasmon decay time (lifetime 1050 fs) (Atwater and Polman 2010). If such conditions are not achieved, the absorbed energy would be dissipated into ohmic damping in the metal. If absorbing material is in close contact to the ﬁeld, absorption would be enhanced due to the high density of states of the photons. This effect can be further enhanced by decreasing the spacing and size/shape of the particles (Pillai and Green 2010; Hubenthal 2011). This type of technique has been shown to be useful in many organic and direct-band gap inorganic semiconductors, where the nanoparticles can be put inside the active absorbing layer rather than on the front or rear of the material surface. Light concentration-based light-trapping arrangement is more suitable and beneﬁcial in case of organic solar cells (Westphalen et al. 2000; Lee et al. 2009; Zhu et al. 2011; Gan et al. 2013). 8.2.3 Enhanced Light Trapping by Surface Plasmon Polariton (SPP) A corrugated metallic ﬁlm on the back surface of a thin photovoltaic absorber layer helps in exciting surface plasmon polariton (SPP). At the metal/semiconductor interface, in-coupling of the sunlight into SPP mode occurs. The light coupled in SPP mode at metal back surface propagates in the plane of the semiconductor layer, where the light is absorbed and converted into photo carriers (Fig. 8.4c). Such SPP coupling mechanism would be beneﬁcial for efﬁcient light absorption and trapping only if absorption of the SPPs in the semiconductor is stronger than in the metal. In such case, the incident light is generally turned by 90 and is absorbed along the lateral direction of the solar cell absorbing material. For such structures to be useful, the lateral dimensions of the semiconductor should be orders of magnitude larger than the optical absorption length. Now, if we look at its application for c-Si solar cells, which is the main focus of this book, out of these three different techniques, most suitable light-trapping geometry would be one which does not inﬂuence the other performance param- eters of solar cells. Since the presence of metal directly inside semiconductor or direct contact with active absorbing material of the solar cell would lead to various recombinations and would result in loss of solar cell efﬁciency. So, the best plasmonic-based light-trapping nanostructure would be the one which is not part of active device. Hence, for c-Si-based solar cells, light concentration using particle plasmons would not be a feasible option. However, light scattering using particle plasmons and light trapping using surface plasmon polariton (SPP) can be 132 8 Plasmonic-Based Advanced Anti-reﬂection  feasible provided the metal nanostructures are separated from active absorbing material, i.e., c-Si slab/wafer by means of some dielectric spacer. In this chapter, the focus have been given on these two methods of light trapping, i.e., light scattering based on particle plasmons and surface plasmon polariton (SPP) in subsequent sections. 8.3 LightMatter Interaction and Plasmonics As discussed earlier, plasmons are collective oscillations of free or conduction electrons and oscillatory motion of the electrons with a characteristic frequency lead to concept of surface plasmons. The surface plasmons are of two types. One is localized surface plasmons (LSP) which is non-propagating in nature and excited in thin ﬁlms or metal nanoparticles/nanostructures by swift electrons. When light interact with the metal nanostructures, depending upon the size, shape, and sur- rounding medium, lightmatter interaction takes place and result in scattering, absorption, and other plasmonic effects. Light is an electromagnetic wave and electromagnetic waves exhibit scattering property when they interact with matter. Electromagnetic scattering is distinguished and named as per their convention and are of two types which are known as (i) elastic scattering and (ii) inelastic scat- tering. Elastic light scattering involves negligible energy loss/transfer. The good examples of elastic scattering are Rayleigh scattering and Mie scattering. In the other type of scattering, i.e., inelastic scattering, there exists energy loss/transfer. Some examples includes Brillion scattering, Raman scattering, inelastic X-ray scattering, Compton scattering etc. (Bohren and Huffman 1983; Roqué et al. 2006). Light scattering are categorized into three different domains based on a dimensionless quantity known as size parameter x, which is deﬁned as per below Eq. (8.1). x ¼ 2p  a  nm k ð8:1Þ Here a represents the particle radius, k represents the wavelength of incident radiation, and nm represents refractive index of medium. Based on the value of x, the domains are categorized as below (Bohren and Huffman 1983): if x  1: Rayleigh scattering (small particle compared to wavelength of light) if x  1: Mie scattering (particle about the same size as wavelength of light) if x  1: Geometric scattering (particle much larger than wavelength of light) When electromagnetic wave/light is scattered by a very small nanoparticle, it is called Rayleigh scattering. Rayleighs model applies when the sphere is smaller in diameter than the wavelength (k) of the scattered wave. Typically, for Rayleigh scattering, the upper limit for particle diameter is taken to be about one-tenth of the 8.2 Plasmonics in Solar Cells 133 wavelength. In this size regime, the exact shape of the scattering center is not very signiﬁcant. For larger diameter spherical particles, i.e., spheres larger than the Rayleigh range, scattering phenomenon is known as Mie scattering. This type of scattering is named after Gustav Mie, who solved the puzzle of scattering from particles of such dimensions. In Mie regime, the shape of the scattering center becomes much more signiﬁcant and the theory applies to sphere shape nanoparticles. Also, it is appli- cable to spheroid and ellipsoid but after certain modiﬁcations (Kreibig and Vollmer 1995). Both Mie and Rayleigh scattering are elastic scattering in which the energy (also wavelength or frequency) of the light is not changed signiﬁcantly. However, Mie scattering and Rayleigh scattering are different from each other in many aspects. Rayleigh scattering occurs symmetrically (Fig. 8.5). On the other hand, Mie scattering shows asymmetrical nature of scattering. It is larger in the forward direction than in the reverse direction. The greater the particle size, the more of the light is scattered in the forward direction (Fig. 8.5). For very small nanoparticles (much smaller than the wavelength of the incident light), strong absorption and weak scattering of the light is observed. However, as the nanoparticle size increases, the contribution of higher order modes due to excitation of multipoles along with dipoles, which are responsible for reradiation of electromagnetic wave from the particle, becomes larger as the ﬁeld across the particle becomes non uniform (RAR Tricker 1970). Scattering by particles similar to or larger than the wavelength of light is typically treated by the Mie theory or the discrete dipole approximation. For particle diameter to wavelength ratio more than 10, laws of geometrical optics are mostly used to describe the interaction of light with the particle. Further, Mie theory, also called LorenzMie theory or LorenzMieDebye theory, is an analytical solution of Maxwells equations for the scattering of Rayleigh Scattering Mie Scattering (Small Particle) Mie Scattering (Large Particle) Fig. 8.5 Schematic for Rayleigh scattering and Mie scattering 134 8 Plasmonic-Based Advanced Anti-reﬂection  electromagnetic radiation by spherical particles (also called Mie scattering as dis- cussed above) (Bohren and Huffman 1983). Note that Mie theory is not an independent physical theory or law. This is the solution of Maxwell equations and therefore the phrase Mie solution, which means solution to Maxwell equations, is considered more appropriate and widely used to address the Mie scattering effect. Mie solutions allow us to calculate the electric and magnetic ﬁelds inside and outside a spherical object. It is generally used to calculate the proportion of light that is scattered; optical cross-sections, etc. In irregularly shaped particles, where both Rayleigh and Mie models do not apply, other numerical methods, e.g., ﬁnite element method (FEM), ﬁnite-difference time-domain method (FDTD), etc., come into picture to explain the observed scattering phenomenon. Now, the other type of lightmatter interaction results in surface plasmon polariton (SPP) which is of propagating nature. SPP is an electromagnetic excita- tion which exists on metaldielectric interface and the electromagnetic (EM) ﬁeld amplitude decays exponentially with distance from the interface/surface in either direction/medium (Zayats et al. 2005). In case of SPP, the interaction of incident electromagnetic light and excitation of surface plasmons greatly depends upon the surface/interface conditions. The electromagnetic ﬁeld of surface plasmon polariton on a metaldielectric interface is usually obtained by solving Maxwells equations with suitable boundary conditions. In 1941, Fano introduced the concept of prop- agating wave at the interface between dielectric and metal. He explained the low reﬂectivity regions observed in wavelength-dependent reﬂectivity measurement on ruled metal gratings by woods (Murray 2005). Different kinds of SPP behavior, e.g., scattering, reﬂection, interference, backscattering and localization etc., can be seen depending upon the surface/ interface conditions. The impact on radiation, when it interacts with dielectric metal interface, is governed by abrupt discontinuity in material properties at the interface. For nonmagnetic materials, the dielectric permittivity (e) of the material plays a major role (Murray 2005) in the lightmater interaction at the interface. More about SPP-based lightmatter interaction and light trapping have been dis- cussed in Sect. 8.6. 8.4 Mie Efﬁciencies When light interacts with nanostructure/nanoparticle, it results in scattering event as well as local ﬁeld enhancements. Nanostructures/nanoparticles have hundreds of atoms/molecules. The resultant interaction of light with the nanostructure depends on how the nanostructure/nanoparticle or atoms/molecules respond to the incident light collectively (see Fig. 8.6). The individual atom/molecule in nanostructure may interact differently and scattered ﬁeld may have different phases. However, the observed scattering in given direction would be resultant of all the scattered ﬁelds. When the nanostructure/nanoparticles are small enough, the scattered ﬁeld may be in phase and observed resultant scattering ﬁeld would not have much dependence 8.3 LightMatter Interaction and Plasmonics 135 on scattering direction. However, if the particle size increases, it would increase the probability of phase variation in scattered ﬁelds which will lead to strong depen- dence on the scattering direction. In such case, geometrical factors like particle shape, size play crucial role. Now to build up concept, the individual atoms/molecules in nanostructure can be conceptualized as dipole/multipoles which scatter the light/electromagnetic ﬁeld. 8.4.1 Scattering and Absorption Efﬁciencies In 1908, Mie presented metal nanoparticles interaction with light and solved Maxwell Equation for appropriate conditions (Lukyanchuk et al. 2007; Lukyanchuk et al. 2010; Garcia2012). The solution to Maxwell equations, also known as Mie solutions, as discussed above, presented an exact solution for spherical nanoparticles (NPs) with an assumption that the NPs are noninteracting. It means the distance between the NPs are large enough. It implies that the electric ﬁeld created by an NP does not affect the rest of them. The analytically solved Maxwell equation solutions for the scattering, extinction (extinction means scat- tering + absorption), and absorption cross-sections are given as in Eqs. (8.2), (8.3), and (8.4) (Bohren and Huffman 1983): Qsca ¼ 2 x2 X 1 n¼1 ð2n þ 1Þðjanj2 þ jbnj2Þ ð8:2Þ Qext¼ 2 x2 X 1 n¼1 ð2n + 1)Re(an + bnÞ ð8:3Þ + - + - + - + - + - + - + - + - + - + - + - + - Light Nanostructure ScaƩered light Internal ﬁeld Fig. 8.6 Schematic of lightnanostructure interaction and scattering event (after Ref.

Qext and Qsca are extinction and scattering efﬁciency by the nanoparticles which is normalized value of extinction and scattering cross-section with the particle projected area. Qabs denotes the absorption efﬁciency of the nanoparticle. an and bn are calculated parameters from Maxwell equation to compute the amplitudes of the scattered ﬁeld. m is complex quantity given by m = er + iek. a represents the radius of the particle. l1 is the ratio of the magnetic permeability of the particle to the magnetic permeability of the ambient medium. jn(z) and h1 n(z) are spherical Bessel functions of order n (n = 1, 2, ) and of the given arguments, z ¼ x=m x respectively. Here, primes mean derivatives with respect to the argument. For the calculation to be practical, all inﬁnite series (see Eqs. (8.2) and (8.3)) must be truncated after nmax terms. For nmax, Bohren and Huffman (Bohren and Huffman 1983) proposed a value which is given as in Eq. (8.10). nmax ¼ x þ 4x1=3 þ 2 ð8:10Þ Further, dipolar approximation also offers simple equations to calculate light absorption of metallic NP, if the NP size is smaller than the light wavelength (Garcia 2011). Mathematically, this approximation can be achieved assuming that x is very very small and hence considering the ﬁrst term n = 1 in Eq. (8.3). In such case, the 8.4 Mie Efﬁciencies 137 nanoparticle acts as Hertzian dipole (Hubenthal 2011). Such quasi-static approxi- mation is valid for a 0.06k (Hubenthal 2011). The quasi-static approximation can also be applicable for nonspherical nanopartilces, nanoparticles in inhomogeneous medium, and can also account for inter-band transition in metals. But, it would require certain modiﬁcation where polarizability should be treated as tensor quantity for nonspherical shape and permittivity to be modiﬁed to take inter-band transition into consideration (Hubenthal 2011). This makes the calculations much more complex and tedious. For a 0.06k, and spherical shape particles, Mie solutions would be more appropriate (Hubenthal 2011). For point dipole model, the solved scattering (Csca) and absorption (Cabs) cross-sections are given by the following Eqs. (8.11) and (8.12) (Bohren and Huffman 1983; Garcia 2012): Cscat ¼ 1 6p 2p k  4 aj j2 ð8:11Þ Cabs ¼ 2p k Im½a ð8:12Þ where, a is polarizability as given by Eq. (8.13): a ¼ 3V ep=em  1 ep=em þ 2   ð8:13Þ Here V is the particle volume, ep is the dielectric function of the particle, and em is the dielectric function of the embedding medium. It is clear from the Eq. (8.13) that when ep ¼ 2em, the particle polarizability would be very very large. Such condition would be the resonance condition. For calculating the optical properties of metallic NPs, the heterogeneous system formed by the NPs and the surrounding media may be replaced by a homogeneous medium with an effective dielectric function eeff 1 þ ieeff 2 (Garcia 2012). Such method is known as effective medium theory. The effective medium theory for effective dielectric function is considered to be more suitable for the case of nanoparticle on substrate. For such case, dielectric constant of environment around nanoparticle is estimated from both environments with which the nanoparticle is in contact (Hubenthal 2011). For case of embedded nanoparticles in inhomogeneous medium, Newton deﬁned an effective dielectric function as an average of the NPs and medium dielectric function weighted by their volume (Garcia 2012). Also, MaxwellGarnett proposed to replace the NPs dielectric medium system by a homogeneous material which can exhibit the same dielectric polarization upon light illumination. This MaxwellGarnetts approach is considered as the best approach within the framework of effective medium theories (Hubenthal 2011; Garcia 2012) and is more appropriate to take interparticle interactions or the presence of non- spherical NPs into account. 138 8 Plasmonic-Based Advanced Anti-reﬂection  8.4.2 Parameters Inﬂuencing the Scattering/Mie Efﬁciencies There are many factors which inﬂuence the scattering of light from nanostructures. It depends upon nanostructure size; nanostructure shape; metal property; dielectric constant of surrounding medium; interparticle spacing; etc. (i) Nanostructure size As you can see from Eqs. (8.2), (8.3), and (8.4), Qsca and Qabs depends on an and bn which is function of size parameter x. Now x depends on size of the particle a, hence the scattering efﬁciency is function of nanostructure size (see Eq. (8.9)). With the increase in size of the particle, the scattering efﬁciency increases and becomes broader, i.e., wide range of wavelengths are scattered (see Fig. 8.7a). Also, the absorption efﬁciency of smaller particles is more (see Fig. 8.7b). It means small particles absorb more light and big particle scatter more light. Also, there is red shift in peak scattering efﬁciency of the particles with increasing size. This indicates the tunability of scattering for different wavelengths by choosing appropriate particle size. In solar cells, if the nanoparticles are being used for scattering purpose, larger size of particles would be preferable. Also, as you can see in Fig. 8.7b, which shows the absorption efﬁciency for the silver-based nanopar- ticles, absorption by silver particles lies in UV wavelength region. Such absorption within nanoparticles would not be favorable when light is expected to be absorbed in active absorbing material of the cell. (ii) Nanostructure shape Nanostructure shape also plays an important role in the effective utilization of scattering property. Larger size particles deposited on a substrate tend to lose their spherical property and looks more like ellipsoids/spheroids. Such shape deforma- tion causes red shifting in the resonance frequency (Pillai et al. 2007). Disks and other similar particle shapes, that have a large fraction of their volume close to the semiconductor, can lead to a very high fraction of light scattered into the substrate Fig. 8.7 a Scattering and b absorption efﬁciencies for silver nanoparticles of different sizes 8.4 Mie Efﬁciencies 139 and may enhance the absorption of light within the active absorbing materials of the cell. For the cylinder and hemisphere shape particles, the fraction of light scattered into the substrate is much higher than that for a spheres shape particle (Catchpole and Polman 2008a). (iii) Metal property Since an and bn as given in Eqs. (8.5) and (8.6) are the function of permittivity (e) of nanostructure (see Eq. (8.8)), and so the scattering and absorption efﬁciencies. Plasmon resonance, at which the scattering or absorption efﬁciencies are maximum, vary and is different for different metal nanostructures. Silver (Ag) exhibits surface plasmon resonance in ultra-violet wavelength region (Catchpole and Polman 2008b). However, for gold (Au) and copper (Cu), surface plasmon resonances lie in the visible wavelength region. Also, the resonance frequency can be tuned by varying the dielectric constant of the embedding medium. More about metal and associated plasmonics properties is discussed in Sect. 8.7. (iv) Dielectric constant of surrounding medium The scattering and absorption efﬁciency of the nanoparticles/nanostructures is very much inﬂuenced by the surrounding medium. The medium permittivity (em) or the effective medium permittivity (eeff ) can be an inﬂuencing parameter and may govern the scattering and absorption. When metal nanoparticles are placed on semiconductor substrate, an effective medium permittivity (eeff ) is considered as discussed in Sect. 8.4.1. With the increase in dielectric constant/permittivity, the scattering efﬁciency increases and becomes broader, i.e., wide range of wavelengths are scattered (see Fig. 8.8a). Also, the absorption efﬁciency of smaller particles is relatively high (see Fig. 8.8b). It indicates that smaller particles absorb more light and bigger particle scatter more light as the effective dielectric constant of medium increases. Also, red shift in peak scattering efﬁciency of the particles is observed as the surrounding medium effective dielectric constant increases. Fig. 8.8 Scattering and absorption efﬁciencies for silver nanoparticles a for different sizes in air (n = 1) and b in air (n = 1) and at silicon nitride (SiNx)/Air interface having effective dielectric function (n) of 1.78 140 8 Plasmonic-Based Advanced Anti-reﬂection  Sharp peaks at lower wavelengths are observed as particle size increases which are due to multipole effect. The multipole effect is due to variation of charge distribution in nanostructures as particle size increases. As the particle size increases, quadruple, octapole etc., oscillations also comes into picture which inﬂuence the scattering and absorption capability of metal nanoparticles. Such control by changing the dielectric medium gives us freedom to adjust and tune the scattering and absorption from/within nanostructures. (v) Interparticle spacing Mie solutions do not account for interparticle spacing and their inﬂuence on each other. However, recent experimental observations have shown that these interac- tions show the inﬂuence on scattering property of the nanostructures/nanoparticles. The scattering of waves involves propagation along different paths and results in interference phenomena. Constructive interference corresponds to resonant enhancement and destructive interference results in resonant suppression. Resonance is usually introduced by the means of a harmonic oscillator with periodic forcing (Miroshnichenko et al. 2010). If the frequency of the driving force is close to the Eigen frequency of the oscillator, the amplitude of the other oscillator grows toward its maximal value. Miroschnichenko et al. (2010) suggests that many physical systems exhibit the opposite phenomenon when their response is sup- pressed and some resonance condition is met. Such resonant destructive interfer- ence is known as Fano resonance. Coherent oscillations of conduction band electrons, i.e., plasmons, govern the optical properties of metals. Also, the charge density oscillations dominate the interaction between light and metallic nanoparticles on the closed surfaces which is known as localized surface plasmon (LSP). Miroschnichenko et al. (2010) suggests that plasmonic nanostructures can be considered as a physical realization of coupled oscillator systems at the nanoscale and indication of Fano resonance presence is observed whenever a resonant suppression of forward scattering (or transmission) is observed. The resonant suppression of forward scattering (i.e., Fano resonance) observed in nanoparticle aggregates where particles are very close to each other (Malynych and Chumanov 2003; Lassiter et al. 2010; Lukyanchuk et al. 2010). Also, a red shift and broadening in surface plasmon resonance is observed when two nanoparticles are closer to each other and dipoledipole interaction occur among them (Hubenthal 2011). 8.5 Backscattering Effect in Nanostructures Scattering efﬁciency tells us about the scattering of light in all directions. However, the scattering can be divided into forward scattering and backward scattering (see Fig. 8.9). Depending upon the application, the particular scattering property from the nanostructure can be utilized. 8.4 Mie Efﬁciencies 141 Following the Mie scattering, backscattering efﬁciency from the nanostructures/ nanoparticles can also be calculated using following Eq. (8.14) (Bohren and Huffman 1983). It indicates the relative scattering in backward direction. Qb ¼ 1 x2 X 1 n¼1 ð2n þ 1Þð1Þnðan  bnÞ   2 ð8:14Þ Here Qb (backscattering efﬁciency) is also known as the radar backscattering efﬁciency where again, x is size parameter, and an and bn, calculated from Maxwell equations, are to compute the amplitudes of the scattered ﬁeld as per Eqs. (8.5) and (8.6) as discussed above. The backscattering efﬁciency is also very much inﬂuenced by particle size and dielectric constant of the surrounding medium. For example, you can see the calculated back-scattering efﬁciency for different sizes of silver nanoparticle in Fig. 8.10a. Increasing the particle size increases the backscattering effect. Also, backscattering occurs for broader wavelength range and red shift is observed in backscattering efﬁciency as the particle size increases. It means more Light Forward scaƩered light Back scaƩered light Nanostructure Fig. 8.9 Schematic for forward and backward scattering of light Fig. 8.10 Back-scattering efﬁciencies for silver nanoparticles a for different sizes in air and b in air and at silicon nitride (SiNx)/Air interface having effective permittivity of 1.78 142 8 Plasmonic-Based Advanced Anti-reﬂection  light of relatively longer wavelengths are scattered due to increase in interaction of light with relatively larger particles. Further, as the surrounding medium changes and effective refractive index is increased for the nanostructure, backscattering efﬁciency for the same particle size is also increased. The impact of surrounding medium with increased effective refractive index/dielectric constant is large if the particle size is large as it can be seen in Fig. 8.10b. Also, red shifting in back-scattering efﬁciency peak occur along with the broadening in wavelength range that can be backscattered. This means by tuning the particle size and surrounding medium, the backscattering effect from nanostructures can be tuned as per requirement. In c-Si solar cells, the backscat- tering effect of nanostructures/nanoparticles can be efﬁciently utilized by keeping them at back surface. More about backscattering application in c-Si solar cell has been discussed in the next chapter. 8.6 Extraordinary Transmission Through MetalDielectric Extended Layers As discussed in Sect. 8.3, lightmatter interaction may also result in surface plas- mon polariton (SPP) which has propagating nature. The electromagnetic excitation at metaldielectric interface results in SPP mode excitation where the electro- magnetic (EM) ﬁeld amplitude decays exponentially with distance from the interface/surface in either direction/medium (Zayats et al. 2005). Abrupt disconti- nuity in material properties at the interface governs the light propagation through such structures. For nonmagnetic materials, dielectric permittivity (e) of the material plays major role in lightmatter interaction and propagation. With proper selection of dielectric and metal interface, and corresponding thickness can enable us to allow or block certain range of wavelengths through the interface. Also, such SPP-based structures provide ability to transmit light where classically it would have been impossible. Such extraordinary ability to tune the light propagation at nanoscale has been recent interest of international scientiﬁc community, especially for solar cell application. For lightmatter interaction, excitation of SPPs at metaldielectric interface is crucial. Wave-vector associated with SPP (kspp) at planar dielectricmetal interface is usually greater than the wave-vector of incident light (klight ¼ ﬃﬃe p ðx=cÞ) (Murray 2005; Zayats et al. 2005). To excite SPP mode, it is important that the associated momentum ðhkÞ of the wave-vectors match. This can be achieved by some surface and interface modiﬁcation, which leads to appropriate SPP mode excitation. Propagation length and Penetration depth are two important parameters to explain the light propagation along the interface or through the interface. Let us have a look about these parameters which have been discussed below. 8.5 Backscattering Effect in Nanostructures 143 8.6.1 Penetration Depth and Propagation Length The spatial extent of electromagnetic ﬁeld amplitude in SPP bounding media is called penetration depth. On the other hand, propagation of SPP mode along the interface before it decays is called propagation length. SPP mode has both longi- tudinal and transverse components of the electromagnetic ﬁeld. Let us consider a metaldielectric interface where metal, having thickness d and permittivity eðxÞ, is on a dielectric layer having permittivity es as shown in Fig. 8.11. Also, consider that the light falls on the metal at airmetal interface and the region z  d represents air, 0  z  d is metal region, and z  0 is dielectric region. In this case, the SPP mode would be excited on airmetal interface and metaldielectric interface. For very small thickness of metal, there would be interaction between these two SPPs excited at airmetal interface and metaldielectric interface; and these would inﬂuence the propagation of each other along the surface. The SPP mode which would have less extent of electric ﬁeld inside the metal would show longer prop- agation length since it would interact with the dissipating medium weakly (Zayats et al. 2005). So, the propagation length of the SPP mode is the length traveled by the elec- tromagnetic ﬁeld associated with SPP mode along the interface till it decayed to 1/e of its initial value and represented by Lspp. It depends on imaginary component of the complex wave-vector ki spp. Since, amplitude decay with distance as Lspp ¼ exp ðki sppxÞ, the intensity, which is square of amplitude, would decay as Lspp ¼ exp ð2ki sppxÞ (Murray 2005). So, the propagation length would be given by following Eq. (8.15): Lspp ¼ 1 2ki spp ð8:15Þ ɛ(ω) ɛs z y x Hy Ex Ez ksp ɛair d (metal) |Esp| ksp Fig. 8.11 Schematic showing surface plasmon on metaldielectric interface (after Ref. Zayats et al. 2005) 144 8 Plasmonic-Based Advanced Anti-reﬂection  Propagation length may vary from few nanometers to more than 100 lm for different wavelengths of light. For corrugated surfaces having periodicity less than propagation length, Bragg scattering may occur for the SPP mode. Such scattering would lead to radiative nature of SPP mode rather than localized nature as localized surface plasmon (LSP). Further, penetration depth is the distance normal to the interface where the electric ﬁeld amplitude is decreased by 1/e from its maximum value at interface. The decay of the ﬁeld occurs as expðki zzÞ, where ki z is imaginary component of the propagation vector (k) in z-direction. So the penetration depth, represented by Lz, can be written as following Eq. (8.16): Lz ¼ 1 jki zj ð8:16Þ For much lesser metal thicknesses, i.e., less than the penetration depth, elec- tromagnetic ﬁeld may interact with both the surfaces (see Fig. 8.11). In such sce- nario, there is strong possibility that light would couple in forward direction and may result in enhanced transmission of light through the metaldielectric interface which would not have been possible otherwise (Economou 1969). In case of metals, the penetration depth is also known as skin depth and is represented by d. It can be co-related with permittivity of the metal. For the metals, the refractive index (n), permittivity (e) as well as propagation wave-vector (k) are complex quantities. The complex wave-vector (k ¼ kr þ iki) is co-related with complex refractive index (n ¼ n þ ik) as per Eq. (8.17). Also, the complex refractive index is co-related with permittivity (e ¼ er þ iek) as in Eq. (8.18): k  ¼ ki þ ikr ¼ n x c ð8:17Þ n  ¼ n þ ik ¼ ﬃﬃﬃﬃ e  q ¼ ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ er þ iek p ð8:18Þ So, the skin depth, d, can be given as in Eq. (8.19): d ¼ 1 ki ¼ c xk ¼ c x ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ  er 2 þ 1 2 ð ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ e2 r þ e2 k p Þ q ð8:19Þ The lesser value of skin depth is useful, especially when the skin depth (d)  mean free path (l). This is because it leads to nonlocal anomalous skin effect (Bohren and Huffman 1983). For silver (Ag), bulk mean free path is 52 nm and the skin depth lies in the range of 2429 nm for 3001200 nm wavelength photons (see Table 8.1). Similarly for aluminum (Al), the bulk mean free path is 16 nm whereas the skin depth is 13 nm for these wavelengths. Also, for copper (Cu) and gold (Au), the bulk mean free path is 42 nm and skin depth is in the range of 3037 nm (see Table 8.1) (Bohren and Huffman 1983). Since the metal thickness is less than skin 8.6 Extraordinary Transmission Through MetalDielectric Extended Layers 145 depth, forward coupling and enhanced transmission through dielectricmetal interface can be expected because for such case, mean free path of electron is larger than the classical skin depth of the metal. So, the SPP mode exited at the metal surface on each side at the metaldielectric interface would be inﬂuenced by each other and there is possibility that it would lead to extraordinary transmission effects (Dai and Jiang 2009). The penetration depth/skin depth tuning and optimized thickness for different plasmonics materials for utilizing the anomalous skin effects can be useful for different applications. For example, silver thin ﬁlms in sandwiched structures have been used for plasma display technology in the past for electromagnetic interference shielding. Suitable metal (Ag) and dielectric multi-stack structure designs have been shown to act as band-pass ﬁlter in visible wavelength range (400700 nm) (Sawada et al. 2001; Tachibana et al. 2003). Also, anomalous skin effect-based lightmatter interaction and light propagation control for solar cell applications has been explored by many researchers. For example, metal thin ﬁlm multilayers, like alu- minum (Al)-doped zinc oxide (ZnO) and silver (Ag), have been explored for transparent conduction layer applications. The multilayer stack of Al:ZnO/Ag/Al: ZnO have been shown to give better conductivity with more light transmission through it (Sahu et al. 2007; Sahu and Huang 2009). Such structures have been proposed as better electrodes/transparent conducting oxides (TCO) for organic/die-sensitized solar cells. Zinc sulﬁde (ZnS) and silver (Ag) multilayer (ZnS/Ag/ZnS) have also been shown to give transparent conducting layers having comparatively better transparency as well as sheet resistance (Leftheriotis 2000). TiO2/Ag/SiO2-based dielectricmetaldielectric sandwiched structure for transpar- ent electrode with better conductivity has been reported recently by Chiu et al. (2014). Also, Zhou et al. (2010) have studied multilayered stack of SiO2 (thickness 60 nm) and Ag (thickness 85 nm) which was milled by focused ion beam to form grating like structures. They have shown promising tunability of transmission for different wavelengths which depends on number of multilayers and grating pitch. 8.6.2 MetalDielectric Extended Layers and Propagation of Light At planner metaldielectric interface, wave-vector associated with SPP mode is larger than the wave-vector associated with light in the neighboring medium as discussed above. So, to excite SPP mode, special arrangements are done such as Table 8.1 Bulk mean free path and skin depth for different metals for 3001200 nm wavelength photons (after Ref. Bohren and Huffman 1983) Metal Bulk mean free path (nm) Skin depth (nm) Ag 52 2429 Al 16 16 Cu 42 3037 Au 42 3037 146 8 Plasmonic-Based Advanced Anti-reﬂection  surface modiﬁcation using diffraction grating. Other methods include total internal reﬂection geometry-based photon tunneling methods. In case of diffraction grating geometry (see Fig. 8.12), components of diffracted light, for which the wave-vector matches with SPP mode wave-vector, is coupled in SPP mode. Light coupling in such conﬁguration is very sensitive to grating structure, grating period, incident wavelength etc. (Murray 2005; Zayats et al. 2005; Sun and Zuo 2011; Fan et al. 2013). In case of total internal reﬂection geometry, there are two important SPP exci- tation conﬁgurations which result in enhanced light coupling: (i) Kretschmann geometry In this geometry, metal ﬁlm is illuminated through dielectric prism with light at an incident angle greater than critical angle for total internal reﬂection as shown in Fig. 8.13. Under resonance condition, a sharp reﬂection minimum is observed from Fig. 8.12 Schematic for SPP excitation in diffraction grating method (after Refs. Murray 2005; Zayats et al. 2005) ϴsp Fig. 8.13 Schematic for SPP excitation and light coupling in Kretschmann geometry (after Refs. Murray 2005; Zayats et al. 2005) 8.6 Extraordinary Transmission Through MetalDielectric Extended Layers 147 metal prism interface and light couple perfectly in SPP mode. In such geometry, metal thickness should be small. If the thickness is large, the SPP excitation would be less. (ii) Otto geometry In this geometry the conditions are analogous to Kretschmann geometry, except the prism. In this case, the prism is placed close to the metal surface and photon tunneling occurs through air gap between prism and surface (see Fig. 8.14). Otto geometry is more appropriate for thick metal ﬁlms, where Kretschmann geometry is not suitable (Zayats et al. 2005). For such geometry, best light coupling occur if the spacer thickness is of the order of wavelength (Murray 2005). All these discussed conﬁgurations are mostly used to explain the enhanced transmission or longitudinal propagation of lights on metaldielectric interfaces. Mostly the structures in such conﬁgurations have metal ﬁlms of thickness, typically, 3540 nm or more (but 100 nm). These structures are also useful in making plasmonic waveguides due to less high propagation lengths (Stegeman et al. 1983; Park et al. 2010; Hu et al. 2013). In summary, metaldielectric extended layers have endless scope of applica- tions. Solar photovoltaic technology has also been beneﬁted from development of such structures. Applicability of such structures in solar cells can be maximized by exploiting the penetration depth or propagation length information and suitably optimizing the light-trapping structures. This provides us ﬂexibility for tuning the light propagation in matter/active absorbing materials and enabling us to control the light transmission and absorption in the solar photovoltaic devices.

Murray 2005; Zayats et al. 2005) 148 8 Plasmonic-Based Advanced Anti-reﬂection  8.7 Choice of Metal for Plasmonics Applications When we talk about plasmonics, it means we talk about collective oscillations of free or conduction electrons. The free and conduction electrons are found in metals and hence the plasmonics is mostly studied for metals. There are many types of metals available in nature and they are unique in their properties. For plasmonics applications, the choice of metal depends on the application we seek. For solar cell application, our target is to trap light in the active absorbing material of the cell. Hence, the metal nanostructure should be such that its plasmonic property should be useful. It means it should help in enhancing the light absorption/coupling in active absorbing material in the desired wavelength range for which the solar cell has probability for efﬁcient performance. For c-Si solar cell, the desired wavelength range is 3001200 nm. This means the choice of metal for plasmonic-based light trapping would depend on the metal plasmonics property such that it helps the cell to utilize maximum of the wavelengths for electricity generation, and there should not be parasitic absorption within the metal. It means low inter-band absorption is desired in metals, especially where the cell has high absorption capability. In case of metal nanoparticles, having spherical shape and in free space, there exist a plasmon resonance frequency which depends on density of free electrons (N) in the metal, effective mass, m (also called optical mass (Kreibig and Vollmer 1995)) of electron in the metal and free-space dielectric constant, e0. The bulk plasmon resonance frequency (xp) for such metal particle is given by the following Eq. (8.20): x2 p ¼ 2Ne2 me0 ð8:20Þ Equation (8.20) indicates the dependence of resonance frequency on the density of free electrons in the particle and optical mass. The density of free electrons for some metals is given in Table 8.2. Also, various parameters/constants for these metals have been tabulated from various references (Brust 1970; Johnson and Christy 1972). Table 8.2 Parameters governing plasmonic properties of various metals Metal Atomic number Electronic conﬁguration Electron densitya (per m3) Optical mass Silver (Ag) 47 [Kr] 4d10 5s1 5.86 1028 0.96 me Aluminum (Al) 13 [Ne] 3s2 3p1 6.03 1028 1.45 me Copper (Cu) 29 [Ar] 3d10 4s1 8.49 1028 1.49 me Gold (Au) 79 [Xe] 4f14 5d10 6s1 5.9 1028 0.99 me aElectron Density = qNa A where Na is Avogadros constant, q is density of metal, A is atomic weight 8.7 Choice of Metal for Plasmonics Applications 149 Also, threshold for inter-band absorption in these metals is given in Table 8.3 (Kreibig and Vollmer 1995). The threshold values for inter-band absorption depend on core electrons of the metals. In nanostructures, surface plasmon resonance (xsp) is of more interest as it governs the lightmatter interaction and it is co-related with bulk plasmon reso- nance (xp). For spherical nanoparticles, for the surface plasmon resonance xsp ¼ ﬃﬃ 3 p xp. For Au, Cu, and Al, surface plasmon resonance lies in the visible wavelength region. For Ag, surface plasmon resonance occurs in ultra-violet wavelength region. The resonance frequency can be tuned by varying the dielectric constant of the embedding medium as discussed in the above section as higher index leads to a red shift in the resonance frequency. Beyond 700 nm, the dielectric functions of Au and Ag are very similar (Catchpole and Polman 2008a). Due to lower absorption in visible wavelength region and lower cost, Ag is considered as better choice than Au. However, Ag must be well encapsulated to avoid oxidation effects which are not the case for Au. Further, Cu is cheaper but absorbs more than Au. In the case for Au and Cu, inter-band transitions leads to decreased efﬁciency of plasmon excitation due to signiﬁcant overlap between the inter-band absorption edge and the plasmon resonance. For Ag, the absorption edge is in the UV (320 nm) and show little impact on the plasmon resonance since it appears at wavelengths larger than 370 nm. Al easily forms oxide very rapidly under atmo- spheric conditions with thickness of about 23 nm, which impacts its plasmonic property (West et al. 2010). Overall, the excitation of the plasmon resonance in Ag particles is more efﬁcient than Au, Cu, and Al particles (Garcia 2011). So, Ag is the preferred choice as plasmonics material in solar cell applications. Further, the inter-band transition in metal nanoparticle/nanostructure is also dependent on the particle size. Gharibshahi et al. (2010) suggest that the quantum conﬁnement effect of the conduction bands is stronger for silver and gold nanoparticles for the diameter less than 20 nm. Such nanostructures/nanoparticles, of size in the range of 1100 nm, contains about 102108 atoms and demonstrate different physical and chemical properties from their bulk and atomic counterparts. A typical schematic of the band structure of a metal nanoparticle can be seen in Fig. 8.15. When light interacts with particle/nanostructure, the occupied ground-state conduction electron absorbs photon energy and excite to the unoc- cupied higher energy state of the conduction band. An increase in the number of atoms produces larger particle sizes. Increased particle size increases the nuclear potential energy of the system and decrease in the Table 8.3 Inter-band absorption threshold in various metals (after Ref. Kreibig and Vollmer 1995) Metal Threshold energy (eV) Threshold energy wavelength equivalent (nm) Silver (Ag) 3.87 320.4 Aluminum (Al) 1.5 826.7 Copper (Cu) 2.1 590.5 Gold (Au) 2.38 521 150 8 Plasmonic-Based Advanced Anti-reﬂection  conduction band energy is observed (conduction band *1/d, d represents size). The conduction band energy of the Ag nanoparticles as a function of diameter can be seen from Fig. 8.15b, as estimated by Gharibshahi et al. (2010). One can see as the particle diameter increases from 4 to 100 nm, the conduction band decreases from 3.065 to 2.895 eV (Gharibshahi 2010). This change in conduction band is more signiﬁcant for the smaller particle sizes than the larger particle sizes. This is the result of strong quantum conﬁnement effects for the smaller Ag particles (sizes 20 nm). So, for scattering purpose, larger particle size would be more preferable where parasitic absorption within the metals can be minimized. In summary, silver is the best material for plasmonic-based light-trapping application, especially for solar cells as it results in relatively low parasitic absorption in visible and NIR wavelength range. However, it has one issue that it degrades in atmospheric ambiance and it requires proper protection or encapsula- tion to avoid such atmospheric reactions. 8.8 Questions and Problems 1.

Avoiding surface texturing in such solar cells would help in getting better surface passivation as planner/ﬂat surface are better and relatively easier to passivate compared to textured surface. This chapter is focused on such plasmonic-based light trapping structure research and developments for c-Si solar cells. Need and applicability of such emerging plasmonic-based light trapping structures in context of c-Si solar cells have been discussed. Also, a broad overview on limitations and solutions has been presented. 9.1 Need for Plasmonic-Based Anti-reﬂection Structure in c-Si Solar Cells Si is indirect band gap semiconductor and the maximum current generation capa- bility is very much dependent on light trapping geometry. As discussed in Chap. 1, with appropriate light trapping geometry, the current generation potential in Si wafer based cells can be greatly enhanced. Depending upon the perfectness of light trapping structure, wafer optical thickness can be enhancement ideally to a maxi- mum 50 times (*4n2) of geometrical thickness. This can make a c-Si wafer based solar cell, having thickness 100200 lm, capable enough to generate a current of about 4343.5 mA/cm2 (refer to Chap. 1, Sect. 1.7). Without any light trapping structure, the cell of the same thickness would be capable of generating current in the range of 3738 mA/cm2 only. However, 50 times optical path length enhancement is an ideal situation. In c-Si solar cell technology, surface texturing technique is used for enhanced light trapping, as we already have seen in Chap. 4 that textured surface at both sides of the wafer is required for better light trapping and the dimension of texture should be in the range of 510 lm. With such  Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017 C.S. Solanki and H.K. Singh, Anti-reﬂection and Light Trapping in c-Si Solar Cells, Green Energy and Technology, DOI 10.1007/978-981-10-4771-8_9 157 arrangement, the Si wafer-based cell would be capable of generating current in the range of 4041 mA/cm2 at its maximum capacity (refer to Chap. 4, Sect. 4.4). In c-Si wafer based cell industry, the drive is toward reducing the cost and improving the cell performance. As per ITRPV analysis, the wafer cost proportion in cell manufacturing, using wafer thickness of 180200 lm, is sustained at about 57%, which is signiﬁcant (see Fig. 9.1a). For reducing the cost of the cell, wafer thickness reduction would be important as it would help in reducing the use of raw material for making the wafer and hence the wafer cost. Signiﬁcant research is being done and techniques are being explored worldwide to make thinner wafer with lower kerf loss. ITRPV predicts that 100 lm or even lower thickness wafer would be in production by 2024 compared to currently used 180200 lm (http:// www.itrpv.net/Reports/Downloads/2014/ 2014). Figure 9.1b shows the expected trend for wafer thickness reduction in coming years. Fabrication of c-Si-based solar cells using much lower thickness wafers would raise many challenges. Light trapping in such thin wafer based c-Si solar cells would be one of the many important challenges. The traditional way for light trapping in c-Si solar cell is surface texturing which would require 510 lm ran- dom pyramids on the wafer surface as discussed above. However, the problem with such textured surfaces in thin wafer based cells is that these would result in com- paratively more surface defects. It would increase the probability of high minority carrier recombination in the surface and junction regions due to increased surface to volume ratio. In such scenario, an alternative way to enhance the light trapping would be necessary where we should be able to enhance the optical thickness of the wafer, i.e., enhanced light trapping within the wafer, without modifying/texturing the wafer surface. Exploration of plasmonic-based advanced light trapping struc- tures may play a crucial role and may become a better solution for c-Si-based solar cell technology. Using such alternative light trapping geometry, where surface texturing can be avoided, would help in getting better surface passivation since planner/ﬂat surface is better and relatively easier to passivate compared to the Fig. 9.1 a Available cell thickness and wafer cost share in cell price for last 5 years. b past, present, and future trend of average wafer thickness reduction with expected technology improvements (after Ref. http://www.itrpv.net/Reports/Downloads/2014/ 2014) 158 9 Plasmonic-Based Light Trapping for c-Si Solar Cell Applications textured surface. This would in result help us to get better electrical performance from the cell. Also, avoiding texturization of surface would have an additional beneﬁt which is minimization of the loss in active absorbing material during tex- turing process. As a rough estimate, a 5 inch 180-lm-thick wafer weight is about 6.7 gm. In texturization process at both sides, which result in about 5 lm pyramids, roughly around 1.2 gm material is lost. It means about 18% active absorbing material by weight is lost considering wafer thickness of about 180 lm. If the wafer thickness would be 100 lm or less, the loss of active absorbing material due to texturization would be more signiﬁcant, i.e., more than 36% by weight for getting same texture size. This makes plasmonic-based alternative light trapping technique more useful in getting better and enhanced current generation potential in thin wafer based cells. This can be possible because there is possibility of using such structures at planer surfaces and surface roughening/texturing required for light trapping can be avoided. Further, mechanical strength in the thin wafers can also be relatively maintained by avoiding absorbing substrate material loss which happens due to surface etching during surface texturing in traditional cell manufacturing process. 9.2 Expectation from Plasmonic-Based Anti-reﬂector or Light Trapping Structure As discussed in above section, the main beneﬁts of developing plasmonic-based alternative light trapping structure would be the replacement of traditional texturization-based light trapping structure. The need of such alternative light trapping is for next-generation thin c-Si solar cells where texturization of surface would not be favorable. If we want to have alternative light trapping structure, then it must be competitive to the existing texturization-based light trapping structure. The question is what and how much we should expect from plasmonic-based light trapping structure? Well, our aim is to get enhanced light trapping; that means enhancement in current generation. The next question would be how much? To answer this question, let us assume a 100 lm wafer based c-Si solar cell. To know the relative enhancement, let us consider the cell with silicon nitride (SiNx) anti-reﬂection coating on planner surface as shown in Fig. 9.2a. Since the target is to replace texturization-based light trapping, let us consider hypothetically that there is a 100 lm wafer based c-Si solar cell which has textured surface (both side) and is coated with SiNx anti-reﬂector coating as shown in Fig. 9.2b. Now, let us simulate the cell electrical performance of such thin c-Si solar cell and see how much relative gain we are expecting? Consider the simulation for two scenarios, i.e., best cell and typical cell scenario as we have already seen in Chap. 6. The simulation parameters used for simulating the electrical performance using PC1D (PC1D 5.9) can be seen in Table 9.1. Here, the main difference is that the assumed wafer thickness is 100 µm in both best cell and typical cell scenarios. Also, the bulk minority carrier 9.1 Need for Plasmonic-Based Anti-reﬂection Structure  159 lifetime, front and back surface recombination velocity has been slightly modiﬁed to see the impact on thin wafer based cells. Silicon nitride (SiNx) anti-reﬂection coating (ARC) with a thickness of 75 nm and refractive index of 2 has been considered for both planer and textured case. The Fig. 9.2 Schematic of 100-lm-thin wafer-based c-Si solar cell with a silicon nitride (SiNx) anti-reﬂection coating on planner surface; b silicon nitride (SiNx) anti-reﬂection coating on textured surface Table 9.1 Simulation parameters for PC1D simulation in best cell scenario and typical cell scenario Solar cell parameters Best cell scenario Typical cell scenario Cell/Wafer thickness 100 lm 100 lm Cell active area 100 cm2 100 cm2 P-type base wafer resistivity 1 Ω cm 1 Ω cm Emitter sheet resistance (after doping) 50 Ω/sq (Diffusion proﬁle: erfc) 50 Ω/sq (Diffusion proﬁle: erfc) Junction depth 400 nm 400 nm Bulk recombination lifetime 400 ls 40 ls Front surface recombination velocity 100 cm/s 104 cm/s Back surface recombination velocity 100 cm/s 1000 cm/s Temperature 300 K 300 K Series resistance 1 mili-Ω 5 mili-Ω Shunt resistance 1000 Ω 100 Ω Reﬂectance proﬁle (simulated) SiNx a and texture + SiNx b SiNx a and texture + SiNx b Light source One Sun, AM 1.5G spectrum One Sun, AM 1.5G spectrum Light intensity 100 mW/cm2 100 mW/cm2 aSiNx 75 nm with RI: 2.0 for planner bBase reﬂectance 3% with texture height 5 lm (both side) for textured +ARC 160 9 Plasmonic-Based Light Trapping for c-Si Solar Cell Applications simulated IV characteristics for the two scenarios can be seen in Fig. 9.3. Also, the comparative electrical performance can be seen as tabulated in Table 9.2. Table 9.2 indicates 3.13.8 mA/cm2 improvement in current generation for textured surface coated with SiNx ARC layer depending upon the cell semicon- ductor parameters. Better cell parameters lead to more current generation compared to typical cell scenario. So, an alternative light trapping structure should be good enough to give relative current enhancement of the order of 33.8 mA/cm2. One more thing to notice from Table 9.2 is that there is reduction in open-circuit voltage (Voc) when ARC coating is on textured surface. This is because of increased (111) planes for pyramidal textured surface which would have more defect states compared to planer (100) surface as discussed earlier also in Chaps. 5 and 6. The defect states increment due to texturing and exposure of more (111) plane on the surface is well accounted in PC1D simulation. So, there is improvement in current generation in textured surface based cell, but there is loss in open-circuit voltage. However, there is a gain in efﬁciency of around 1.31.5% absolute. Hence, for plasmonic-based light trapping structure, if implementable on planer surface, the target should be to achieve relative efﬁciency gain of 1.31.5%. Fig. 9.3 Simulated IV characteristics of 100 lm c-Si wafer-based solar cell having ARC coating on planer surface and on textured surface in two cell conditions Table 9.2 Cell performance parameters as per PC1D simulation Cell Open-circuit voltage (Voc) (mV) Short-circuit current (Jsc) (mA) Efﬁciency (η) (%) Planer + SiNx ARC Best 657.5 34.9 19.1 Textured + SiNx ARC Best 646.6 38.4 20.6 Planer + SiNx ARC Typical 622.3 33.7 16.9 Textured + SiNx ARC Typical 615.4 36.8 18.2 9.2 Expectation from Plasmonic-Based Anti-reﬂector  161 In summary, when we talk about replacing texturing at lower thickness wafer based cell, the expectation should be a gain in both current and open-circuit voltage generation and it should be enough to translate the overall gain in efﬁciency of about 11.5% absolute. Also, it should be implementable with cost-effective manner with less/negligible inﬂuence on the existing cell manufacturing process. 9.3 Plasmonic-Based Anti-reﬂection Structure Suitable for c-Si Solar Cells Various ways of using plasmonic-based light trapping structure for different kinds of solar cells have already been discussed in Chap. 8. We have discussed in Sect. 8.2 that there are three ways which can be exploited for enhanced light trapping in active absorbing material of the solar cells. Now, let us focus here on c-Si solar cells where we use c-Si wafers for cell fabrication. Incorporating metal nanostructures within wafer materials in controlled way would not be feasible because of the way wafers are produced. However, let us say it is possible, but it would not be favorable option as the presence of metals in absorbing material act as recombination centers and would degrade the wafer/cell electrical properties. The major impact would be on minority carrier lifetime which is one of the most important parameters of the c-Si wafer based solar cell. Hence, the remaining suitable way for using plasmonic-based light trapping structure would be either on the front surface or back surface of the cell active absorbing material as shown in Fig. 9.4a and b. The next question is what kind of plasmonic-based light trapping structure would be beneﬁcial for c-Si wafer based solar cell technology? As we know the c-Si wafer based cell acƟve absorbing material c-Si wafer based cell acƟve absorbing material Plasmonic based light trapping structure at front Plasmonic based light trapping structure at back (a) (b) Fig. 9.4 Schematic for plasmonic-based light trapping structure for c-Si wafer-based technology where light trapping structure should be used at a front surface; b back surface 162 9 Plasmonic-Based Light Trapping for c-Si Solar Cell Applications band gap of c-Si material is about 1.12 eV and it is capable of absorbing light of 3001200 nm wavelengths, it means the light trapping structure should be such that it could provide broadband anti-reﬂection or efﬁciently scatter the light of these wavelengths into the c-Si material. Well, there has been lots of interest recently in the scientiﬁc community to exploit plasmonic-based different metal/dielectric nanostructures for achieving enhanced light trapping in the cell. Also, lots of exploration on appropriate design and their feasibility for c-Si solar cell applications are still in progress. Further, there are many metal nanostructures or combination of metal and dielectric nanostructures which can be possible candidate for such applications, e.g., nano-holes/voids in metal ﬁlms (Fig. 9.5a), metal grating based corrugated surface (Fig. 9.5b), metaldielectric multilayer stacks (Fig. 9.5c), metal nanoparticles (Fig. 9.5d), etc. Once we choose the structure, next thing to look at is its implementation in c-Si wafer based technology. The structure should be such that it provides less-complicated path for fabrication and should be a better substitute of traditional texturing-based light trapping structure. Metal grating based corrugated surfaces are generally used for light coupling along the surface and mostly 3050 nm or even more metal thicknesses are used. Further, nano-holes/voids in metals had been explored for better SPP coupling and enhanced transmission by many researchers in recent years. However, the enhanced transmission wavelength range is very narrow and very much sensitive to hole/void Metal Dielectric Metal Dielectric (a) (b) (c) (d) Nano holes in metal thin film Metal grating based corrugated surface Metal nanoparticles Fig. 9.5 Possible plasmonic-based light trapping structures a nano-holes/voids in metal ﬁlms; b metal gratings based on corrugated surface; c metaldielectric multilayer stack; d metal nanoparticles 9.3 Plasmonic-Based Anti-reﬂection Structure Suitable  163 diameter, pitch and metal thickness, etc. (Murray et al. 2004; Genet and Ebbesen 2007; Dunbar et al. 2012; Zeng et al. 2013; Callahan et al. 2013). Also, the complexities involved in such processes are high. Other options which may be easier as well as cost effective are random nanoparticles or metaldielectric multilayer stack. However, in such structures, the metals should be separated from active absorbing material via a spacer/dielectric layer. Appropriate combination of dielectric layer and metal nanostructure may result in better in-coupling of light. As discussed in Sects. 8.4 and 8.5 in the previous chapter, nanoparticles can be utilized in two ways. In one case, it can be used at front as shown in Fig. 9.6a and nanoparticles forward scattering property can be utilized. In other case, nanoparticles can be used at bottom as shown in Fig. 9.6b, and its backscattering property can be exploited. Also, dielectricmetal multilayer stack (see Fig. 9.6c) can be explored on c-Si wafer where the ﬁrst layer is dielectric. In such case, one should look for optimized structure where minimum numbers of layers are required and it should be capable of providing better in-coupling of light for broader wavelength range. The three probable light trapping structures as shown in Fig. 9.6 can be implementable without disrupting much the existing wafer-based cell fabrication process and would be favorable for thin c-Si wafer based solar cells. Note that the discussions made here are based on suitability and appropriateness accounting the c-Si solar cell design and requirement. However, such light trapping structures are still in research and development phase and a lot more research is required before such structures can be integrated into c-Si wafer based cell fabrication process. Advancement and recent developments in these light trapping structures appropriate for c-Si wafer based solar cells is covered in next section. c-Si wafer based cell acƟve absorbing material Spacer c-Si wafer based cell acƟve absorbing material Spacer c-Si wafer based cell acƟve absorbing material Dielectric Metal Dielectric Nanoparticles on front with spacer layer for forward scattering based light trapping Nanoparticles at back with spacer layer for backward scattering based light trapping Dielectric-metal multi layer stack for forward coupling based light trapping (a) (b) (c) Fig. 9.6 Schematic of different light trapping structures, where a nanoparticles are placed at front using spacer/dielectric layer; b nanoparticles are placed at back using spacer/dielectric layer; and c dielectricmetal multilayer stack, on c-Si wafer-based cell active absorbing material 164 9 Plasmonic-Based Light Trapping for c-Si Solar Cell Applications 9.4 Recent Advancement in Plasmonic-Based Anti-reﬂector Development Till now we have discussed different aspects of plasmonic-based light trapping structures. Now, let us see the recent advances in applications of plasmonics structures in the ﬁeld for c-Si wafer based cell technology. As categorized above in three most appropriate designs, i.e., nanoparticles at front, nanoparticles at back, and dielectricmetal sandwiched structures, let us see the updates from the scientiﬁc community in this direction for each design. 9.4.1 Nanoparticles at Front First of all, let us see the nanoparticles at front for enhanced light trapping in c-Si wafer based solar cells. As discussed in the previous chapter that nanoparticles scatter light and depending upon the dielectric environment, particle size, and shape, the scattering efﬁciency can be tuned. In 2007, a study on such nanoparticles at front-based light trapping structure, for 1.25 lm SOI (silicon on insulator) and double-sided polished 300 lm Si wafer based cells was presented by Pillai et al. (2007). In their study, they used silver nanoparticles deposited by thermal evapo- ration followed by annealing in nitrogen ambient at 200 C for 5060 min. For different sizes of particles, they deposited different mass thicknesses of silver thin ﬁlms. The light trapping potential was studied by measuring the wavelength-dependent current from their devices for visible to IR wavelengths. They reported a relative increase in photocurrent for device with best optimized nanoparticle structure compared to without nanoparticle-based devices. For 1.25-lm-thick silicon-on-insulator based solar cells, close to 16-fold enhancement at around 1050 nm for particle sizes corresponding to 16 nm mass thickness of silver is shown. They showed 33% increment in current generation potential for cell having nanoparticles corresponding to 12 nm mass thickness, as compared to a similar cell having no nanoparticles. Also, for nanoparticles fabricated from 16 nm silver mass thickness, the cell showed 16% relative current enhancement. The current had been calculated from measured wavelength-dependent photocurrent and was averaged over the AM1.5G radiation. Their device architecture used for study and corresponding relative current enhancement result can be seen in Fig. 9.7a for SOI-based solar cell and in Fig. 9.7b for 300-lm double-side polished Si solar cell. For the 300 double-side polished Si solar cells, different particle sizes on 30 nm top oxide resulted in increase of 19%, 14%, and 2% in the photocurrent where the nanoparticles were fabricated from 12, 14, and 16 nm mass thickness of silver, respectively. Mostly, the enhancements were observed at longer wavelengths with larger particles. These enhancements were near band gap of Si where the potentials for enhancement are larger due to enhanced light trapping of weekly absorbed light. 9.4 Recent Advancement in Plasmonic-Based Anti-reﬂector Development 165 The enhancement shown by Pillai et al. (2007) was encouraging; however, these were relative increment for solar cells which has 30 nm silicon oxide as spacer layer. Also, the enhancement was mostly for longer wavelengths and for shorter wavelength, reduction in photocurrent generation was observed. In c-Si solar cells, about 80100-nm-thick silicon oxide/nitride is used for anti-reﬂection purpose for which reﬂection is very very low from top surface (less than 1%) in 550600 nm wavelength range. The improvements shown by Pillai et al. (2007) may not be comparable with standard anti-reﬂection layer; however, it indicates nice light trapping behavior of nanoparticles used at front surface of the cell. Toward exploring best optimized nanoparticles on front-based light trapping geometry, Spinelli et al. (2011) explored Ag nanoparticle arrays fabricated by means of electron beam lithography (EBL). Their test samples were 300 lm p-type single-side polished mono-crystalline Si wafers and had phosphorus-diffused emitter coated with a Si3N4 layer using plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD). Ag nanoparticle arrays were fabricated on top of Si3N4 layer using EBL, silver evaporation, and lift-off processes. They studied nanoparticle array on front of the cell structure. The structure had dense-arrayed Ag particles with a surface coverage of 20%. Different Ag particle arrays in ﬁelds of 100 lm by 100 lm having different particle widths and array pitches along with different Si3N4 layer thicknesses for optimal light in-coupling were studied. For 180-nm-wide particles with a 450 nm array pitch, they reported their best anti-reﬂection structure. Measured specular reﬂection coefﬁcients for different particle geometries where particle width/size, array pitch, and Si3N4 thickness on a Si substrate were varied, are shown in Fig. 9.8. Also, right-side SEM image in Fig. 9.8 shows the fabricated silver nanoparticle array by EBL. The specular reﬂection coefﬁcients, which were weighted reﬂectance averaged for AM 1.5G spectrum in the wavelength range of 450900 nm, were shown to be reduced from 5.7 to 1.4% with optimized particle array.

Even with using most sophisticated method to fabricate well-controlled silver nanoparticles with optimized size and pitch, there was relatively high reﬂection in 600800 nm (see Fig. 9.9). Here also the reﬂection reduction was mainly observed in infrared wavelength region. In 2012, El Daif et al. (2012) presented a study where they had explored metal nanoparticles for thin c-Si solar cells toward utilizing the scattering property of nanostructures at front. Silver (Ag) nanodiscs on the surface of epitaxial cells grown on highly doped silicon substrates were investigated to exclusively see the effect of metal nanostructure (nanodiscs) on the front surface. For the nanodiscs, which were Fig. 9.8 Measured specular reﬂection coefﬁcient for different particle geometries with varying particle width/size, array pitch, and Si3N4 thickness, on a Si substrate.

However, when compared with cells having standard dielectric anti-reﬂection coating, relative decrease in efﬁciency was observed. Their test cell structure and the measured external quantum efﬁciency are shown in Fig. 9.10a and b, respectively. The test cell structure had active layer thickness of 210 lm and the substrate thickness was more than 200 lm. The two cells had stack of Al/highly doped Si substrate (700 lm)/epi Si (10 lm)/SiO2 (13 nm)/Ag nanodiscs (60 nm)/SiO2 (95 nm) and Al/highly doped Si substrate (700 lm)/epi Si (10 lm)/SiO2 (108 nm). An improved performance with respect to bare silicon-based cell, but barely any improvement with respect to the dielectric layer based light trapping structure, has been demonstrated in this study. The main reason for reduced performance with nanodisc-based light trapping structure was reduced photocurrent in visible wavelength region as you can see in Fig. 9.10b. However, there was relative improvement in EQE for longer wavelengths. In nanoparticle-based structures, mostly backscattering effects are observed and that lies in visible range for 60100 nm particles which result in high reﬂection in those wavelengths region and lower photocurrent generation. Singh et al. (2014) presented a study for silver nanoparticles on front surface of Si wafer having different spacer/dielectric thicknesses and compared the backscattering efﬁciencies from such structures. It has been showed that the high reﬂection regions in such structures are exactly in the same range as measured the total reﬂection from the samples. One such result of measured reﬂectance and compared backscattering efﬁciency can be seen in Fig. 9.11 where silver nanoparticles of about 60 nm size were fabricated on Si wafer coated with about 65 nm silicon nitride (SiNx) spacer/dielectric layer. In summary, metal nanoparticles/nanostructure at front surface-based light trapping and reﬂection reduction in broad wavelength range are still a major challenge and research and development activity in this direction in search of suitable design is still undergoing.

As discussed in Sect. 8.5 of previous chapter, the backscattering effect and backscattering efﬁciency of a nanostructure can be tuned. It depends on nanostructure/particle size and surrounding dielectric medium. However, using nanoparticles at back surface has limitation that it can interact only with those wavelengths which reach till back surface. For c-Si solar cells, when we talk about 80100 lm wafer for cell fabrication, the expected wavelengths which would reach till bottom would be 850 nm or longer. It means the backscattering effect in the nanostructure should be optimized for IR wave- lengths. For these wavelengths, the required particle size for better backscattering would be large, about 1 lm or more. For very thin wafers, lower size particle can also be beneﬁcial. Further, the dielectric spacer layer is also important as shown in Fig. 9.12 to avoid the direct contact with c-Si substrate which is active absorbing material. So, appropriate and effective ways to make back contact while using such light trapping structures should also be explored; for example, Al grids like contact as shown in Fig. 9.12. Beck et al. (2010) did study to explore the use of nanoparticles at back and its impact on thin c-Si solar cell performance. The experiments were performed on Fig. 9.11 Measured total reﬂectance and comparison with calculated backscattering efﬁciency for similar structure (from Plasmonics, Broadband reﬂection minimization using silver ultra-thin ﬁlm sandwiched between silicon nitride layers for c-Si solar cell application, 9, 2014, 14091416, Singh H.K., Sharma P, Solanki C.S., Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014, with permission of Springer) 9.4 Recent Advancement in Plasmonic-Based Anti-reﬂector Development 169 22-lm-thin c-Si solar cells. The cell had a double-side dielectric layer structure with 10 nm of thermally grown SiO2, 8 nm of Si3N4, and 82 nm of TiO2 at front surface. At back surface, there was 10 nm of thermally grown SiO2, 8 nm of Si3N4, and nanoparticles over-coated with 89 nm of TiO2. Figure 9.13 shows the device geometry. For random Ag nanoparticles fabrication, 18 nm layers of Ag had been deposited by thermal evaporation which was annealed at 230 C for 50 min in an atmosphere of N2. The particles had equivalent diameters in the range of 50 204 nm and the average equivalent diameter was 131 nm. Also, surface coverage was 36% and had a ﬂattened hemispherical shape with a height of *50 nm. The study showed relative photocurrent enhancements in such thin c-Si solar cells due to enhanced light trapping by self-assembled, random Ag nanoparticles at back surface. Note that the particles located at the rear of the cells had over-coating of TiO2. With such geometry, relative increase in photocurrent of about 10% for the 22 lm Si cells due to increased light trapping was demonstrated. Also, it was observed that incorporation of a detached mirror behind the nanoparticles further increases the photocurrent and the relative enhancement goes up to 13%. For thick (180200 lm) wafer based c-Si solar cells, there is problem using nanoparticles at back as it requires bigger nanoparticles and fabrication of big Evaporated Al c-Si solar cell Metal NPs Light Dielectric spacer Al Grid Fig. 9.12 Schematic of a typical c-Si solar cell where nanoparticles can be used at back surface and their backscattering properties can be exploited 22 μm Si 82 nm TiO2 8 nm Si3N4 10 nm SiO2 Ag NPs over coated with 89 nm of TiO2 Ag Mirror Light Fig. 9.13 Schematic of the experimental device geometry used by F. J. Beck et al. (Beck et al. 2010); (after Ref. Beck et al. 2010) 170 9 Plasmonic-Based Light Trapping for c-Si Solar Cell Applications nanoparticles (  1 lm) is very complicated. However, there have been reports of using dielectric-based nanospheres and utilizing the backscattering effects in such structures for cell performance enhancement. For example, Eisenlohr et al. (2015) explored the light trapping enhancement in 200-lm-thick c-Si solar cell using silicon oxide (SiO2) based dielectric spheres at back as discussed in Sect. 7.3 of Chap. 7. The relative enhancement demonstrated was equivalent to 0.4 mA/cm2 current enhancement where the device was having front surface textured and rear surface planer in combination with dielectric spheres (of size about 1 lm size). The comparison was made with a device having front surface textured and rear surface planer and without dielectric spheres. Also, for the device having front surface planer and rear surface planer in combination with dielectric spheres showed absorption enhancement equivalent to 1.6 mA/cm2 current when compared with device having front and rear both surfaces planer. For high-efﬁciency cells, nanoparticle-based structure at back surface is also being explored. For example, Yang et al. (2012) explored the use of the nanoparticles at back surface of the passivated emitter and rear totally diffused (PERT) solar cells. A total current enhancement of 18.4% for passivated emitter and rear totally diffused (PERT) cells, which were fabricated on 400 lm p-type FZ Si wafers, were demonstrated. These total current enhancements were calculated for wavelength range of 9001200 nm only, which actually reaches till bottom surface of a 400-lm-thick cell. Silver nanoparticles had been used at back surface which were fabricated at optimized 19 nm SiO2 spacer layer. With addition of detached metal mirror, they showed maximum current enhancement of 27% from such backscattering reﬂectors. The rear side schematics of the PERT solar cell used is shown in Fig. 9.14a. Also, the relative photocurrent enhancement curve for dif- ferent arrangements of light trapping structure at back can be seen in Fig. 9.14b. In summary, metal nanoparticles/nanostructure at back surface enhances the light trapping but mostly in IR wavelength region. And its advantage is that it does not inﬂuence the high energy photons which might have got reﬂected if it would Fig. 9.14 a Schematics for rear side of PERT solar cell with Ag nanoparticles and detached Ag metal reﬂector; b relative photocurrent enhancement curve for different arrangements of light trapping structure at back (Reprinted from Sol Energy Mater Sol Cells, 101, Yang Y, Pillai S, Mehrvarz H, et al., Enhanced light trapping for high-efﬁciency crystalline solar cells by the application of rear surface plasmons, 217226, 2012, with permission from Elsevier) 9.4 Recent Advancement in Plasmonic-Based Anti-reﬂector Development 171 have been at front. However, when we talk about reﬂection reduction in broad wavelength range to replace texturization-based light trapping structure in thin c-Si wafer based cells, only nanoparticles at back could not be a sole solution. Further research and development for suitable design is needed. 9.4.3 DielectricMetal Sandwiched Structure Now, let us see the updates about dielectricmetal sandwiched structure for enhanced light trapping in c-Si wafer based solar cells. As discussed in the previous chapter that using proper combination of metal and dielectric thin ﬁlms, the reﬂection can be reduced from the surface and absorption in the cell active absorbing material can be enhanced. Suitable metal (Ag) and dielectric multi-stack structure designs have been shown to act as band pass ﬁlter in visible wavelength range (400700 nm) (Sawada et al. 2001; Tachibana et al. 2003). Also, recent interest has been shown by scientiﬁc community for making transparent and better conducting electrodes for organic solar cells as pointed out in Sect. 8.6. However, for c-Si solar cell technology, there has been very little development in this type of light trapping structure. In a recent approach in exploiting such dielectricmetal sandwiched structure, Singh et al. (2016) has explored ultra-thin silver ﬁlm sand- wiched between silicon nitride dielectric layers for reﬂection reduction and enhanced light trapping for c-Si solar cell applications. Figure 9.15a shows the schematic for dielectricmetaldielectric (DMD)-based light trapping structure for c-Si solar cell. Figure 9.15b shows the relative EQE enhancement for a c-Solar cell having DMD light trapping structure (PV-2) compared to a c-Si solar cell having standard anti-reﬂection coating (ARC) (PV-1). Using such DMD-based light trapping structure, Singh et al. (2016) reported reﬂection reduction for broad wavelength range (3001200 nm). For broad wavelength range, the weighted reﬂectance (weighted for 3001200 nm wavelengths with AM 1.5G solar spectrum) was demonstrated in the range of 89% with best optimized DMD light trapping structure. Also, for a 180 lm c-Si solar cell, external quantum efﬁ- ciency (EQE) improvement showed a photocurrent enhancement equivalent to 0.5 mA/cm2 with DMD sandwiched structure when compared to standard SiNx anti-reﬂection coating (ARC) structure. EQE enhancement was reported for all wavelengths above 700 nm with maximum 2526% enhancement at around 1125 nm, i.e., near band gap of c-Si material. In the DMD structure, the ultra-thin silver ﬁlm had thickness of about 8 nm and SiNx dielectric layers sandwiching it had about 80 nm thicknesses. Slight reduction in photocurrent is observed in visible region which was attributed to non-continuum silver ﬁlm which leads to backscattering effect as seen in nanoparticles. Singh et al. (2016) had speculated that if silver ultra-thin ﬁlm could be made continuous, the backscattering can be minimized and much better gain in cell performance would be achievable. The advantage of using such structure would be that it can be implemented at any thickness of wafer without disrupting much of the existing fabrication processes. 172 9 Plasmonic-Based Light Trapping for c-Si Solar Cell Applications However, this type of structure is still in research and development phase. Exploration of the easy fabrication method for ultra-thin Ag ﬁlm with most con- tinuum, angle-dependent reﬂection behavior of DMD anti-reﬂector and realiza- tion of best optimized DMD anti-reﬂection structure on thinner c-Si wafer based cells would be important and should be focus for future investigations (Singh 2016) before such structure can be a implementable solution and alternative to traditional texturization-based technology. 9.5 Present Limitations for Plasmonic-Based Anti-reﬂector Development and Implementations As discussed, plasmonic-based anti-reﬂector or light trapping structure may replace the existing texturization-based light trapping structure, as such structures may not be favorable for next-generation thin c-Si solar cell technology. However, to reach the implementation target for such plasmonic-based light trapping structure, for next-generation thin wafer based c-Si solar cells, it has many hurdles. If we talk about nanoparticle at front-based light trapping structure, there is no evidence and demonstration available till date which can indicate broadband reﬂection mini- mization, especially in wavelength range of 3001200 nm which is important for c-Si solar cells. Such structures with proper combination of dielectric spacer layer are able to give good anti-reﬂection behavior in infrared wavelength region but high Fig. 9.15 a Schematic of dielectricmetaldielectric (DMD)-based light trapping structure for c-Si solar cell; b relative EQE enhancement for PV-2 (c-Solar cell having DMD light trapping structure) compared to PV-1 (c-Solar cell having standard anti-reﬂection coating (ARC)) (from Plasmonics, Opto-electrical performance improvement of mono c-Si solar cells using dielectric metaldielectric (DMD)-sandwiched structure based plasmonic anti-reﬂector, 11, 2016, 323 336, Singh H.K., Arunachalam B., Kumbhar S., Sharma P, Solanki C.S., Springer Science +Business Media New York 2015, with permission of Springer) 9.4 Recent Advancement in Plasmonic-Based Anti-reﬂector Development 173 reﬂection in visible wavelength region due to backscattering effect overshadows this gain. Such backscattering effect in random nanoparticles is fundamental limi- tation of using it at front as suitable light trapping structure for speciﬁed 300 1200 nm wavelength range. Further, putting backscattering effect of nanoparticles at good use by using them at back surface of the cell brings certain advantages like avoiding unnecessary back reﬂection of useful visible wavelengths. However, such structures are useful for enhancing the light trapping for those wavelengths which reaches till bottom sur- face of the cells, i.e., longer wavelengths above 850900 nm. To scatter these wavelengths back efﬁciently, the particle size should be  1 lm. Fabricating these size metal nanoparticles would be a challenge when we target cost-effective and easier way. Also, such structures would not be beneﬁcial for broad wavelength range where we target to replace texture-based light trapping technology. This is because it would not help in reﬂection reduction and forward in-coupling of light at front surface as it is placed at back surface. Now, if we look at the design and suitability of dielectricmetaldielectric-based sandwiched structure at front surface as discussed in above section, it seems promising. However, such structures are still in very early phase of development and lots of research and developments are needed. Singh et al. (2016) point out that such structure would require ultra-thin metal ﬁlms having thickness less than 8 nm. However, at such lower thickness, it is very difﬁcult to have continuous ﬁlm which is necessary requirement to avoid any back reﬂection effect in visible wavelength regions. The aim for such light trapping structure development should be toward exploration for easy fabrication method for continuous ultra-thin metal ﬁlms. This will help in minimization of reﬂection in broad wavelength range so that it becomes comparable to textured surface based light trapping structures. Also, the emphasis should be on fabrication for such DMD anti-reﬂection structure that it does not degrade the ultra-thin metal ﬁlm during fabrication process. This is necessary to avoid tarnishing effects in metals which leads to parasitic absorption losses. There are many metals with good plasmonic property which are to be explored for such applications, like gold, silver, aluminum, etc. However, the target should be to use metals having lower percolation threshold (8 nm). Here, lower perco- lation threshold means ultra-thin metal ﬁlms that can be fabricated with more continuums at lower thickness. Also, while choosing metal ﬁlm and dielectric materials, negative impact from those should also be considered as it should not inﬂuence the minority carrier lifetime or passivation quality of the surface in c-Si solar cells negatively. In summary, more detailed theoretical and experimental study for better understanding and to achieve better anti-reﬂection effects using such DMD-based sandwiched structures is needed. More in-depth insights would enable better understanding of the anti-reﬂection phenomenon and easy as well cost-effective implementation for such light trapping structures. 174 9 Plasmonic-Based Light Trapping for c-Si Solar Cell Applications 9.6 Questions and Problems 1.

Discussion has been made mainly on the future advancement needed in light trapping structure development and a brief projection for certain areas which can be of immediate interest for research and development community. 10.1 Exploration of MetalDielectric Extended Layers Dielectricmetal sandwiched structures have been explored for different applica- tions by different research groups as discussed in the previous chapter. However, in the ﬁeld of solar cells, there has seen recent interest in organic solar cells and c-Si solar cells. In organic solar cells, the aim has been to have highly transmitting and better conduction layer with dielectricmetal sandwiched structure (Sahu et al. 2007; Sahu and Huang 2009; Zhou et al. 2010; Chiu et al. 2014). The aim of such structures in c-Si solar cell technology is to replace texturization-based light trap- ping structure with the alternative which would show better anti-reﬂection for broad wavelength range (Singh et al. 2016). Such dielectricmetal sandwiched structure-based light trapping designs are still in very early phase of research and require lots of research and development in this area. The very ﬁrst requirement would be the fabrication method for ultra-thin metal ﬁlm with utmost continuum. Better anti-reﬂection properties from dielectricmetal dielectric (DMD) sandwiched structures have been demonstrated but for those metal ﬁlms which has utmost continuous surface and much lesser thickness. It is one of the major challenges since different metals have different percolation thresholds. For example, silver has percolation threshold of 1012 nm with phys- ical vapor deposition technique (Sergeant et al. 2012). However, gold deposited by similar technique has percolation threshold of 7 nm or even lesser. It is worth mentioning that percolation threshold can be tuned. It depends on fabrication  Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017 C.S. Solanki and H.K. Singh, Anti-reﬂection and Light Trapping in c-Si Solar Cells, Green Energy and Technology, DOI 10.1007/978-981-10-4771-8_10 177 method and involved process condition like used substrate material, deposition rate, substrate temperature, etc. One can explore different methods and process condi- tions for controlling the percolation threshold, i.e., fabrication of continuous ﬁlm at lower thicknesses. Also, one should look for such fabrication methods which do not degrade the metal ﬁlm. For example, silver and aluminum are very sensitive to the exposure of air and form oxides. The oxide formation results in tarnishing effects which lead to parasitic absorption losses in such DMD structures as highlighted in previous chapter. Another aspect of research can be exploration of different dielectric ﬁlms with different sandwiched metals which may result in much better passivation of c-Si surface. Also, comparative study to observe and understand the role of ultra-thin metal ﬁlms in improving the surface passivation quality can be done. It is well known that if the thickness of dielectric ﬁlm is doubled, it would positively impact the surface passivation quality. So, DMD structure should also lead to better passivation of the surface. However, there has been no comparative experimental study yet and can be an area of interest for further in-depth study. The next topic of interest can be angle-dependent reﬂection behavior of DMD anti-reﬂector. Since, in real application scenario, the cell faces sun at different angles from morning to evening. This leads to requirement of better broadband anti-reﬂection in wide angle range for the incident light. More about angle-dependent reﬂection reduction requirement has been discussed later in Sect. 10.3. Finally, at the end, what matters most is the realization of best optimized DMD anti-reﬂection structure on thinner c-Si wafer based cells and the associated cost analysis. Study on stability of such structures in different environmental conditions would be an important area since the cell has to give stable performance and should last long. Stability of DMD anti-reﬂection structure would be important if it is to be adopted by any industry as alternative to traditional texturization-based technology. Also, for solar cells where cost is more important to make it available for masses, such light trapping structures must be cost effective and easy to implement. Figure 10.1 shows a most general device design with DMD-based light trapping structure. Note that there may be certain changes in device design when we move for thin c-Si wafer based cell application with such DMD light trapping structures. This may lead to many other challenges which may be crucial for future developments. c-Si solar cell D-M-D anƟ-reﬂector Back contact Doped emiƩer region Front contact Fig. 10.1 Schematic of a most general c-Si wafer based cell design with DMD anti-reﬂection structure 178 10 Future Scope in Advanced Lighting  In summary, there are lots of possibilities and opportunities for research and development in this type of plasmonic-based anti-reﬂector and there is long way to go before such technology can reach to industry application stage. 10.2 Nanoparticles at Back Surface of c-Si Solar Cells Now, let us talk about future scope and further research and development for nanoparticles at back surface to enhance light trapping in c-Si solar cells. As we have already discussed in Sect. 9.4.2 that such structures utilize the backscattering property of the nanoparticles, such light trapping structures would be useful but only for longer wavelengths even if the used c-Si active absorbing material thickness is very low (as low as 22 lm (Beck et al. 2010)) as discussed in the previous chapter. Therefore, the main utilization of such light trapping structures would be for high-efﬁciency c-Si solar cells and cells where we can target to replace the back surface textures with nanoparticles as shown in Fig. 10.2. Presently, in c-Si solar cell fabrication process, both sides are textured where the role of back side surface is to further randomize the direction of back-reﬂected light. In such scenario, if the back surface texturing is to be avoided while still texturing the front surface, nanoparticles at back can be a good option. Some positive results have already been reported by Eisenlohr et al. (2015) using dielectric spheres (silicon oxide) at back. From implementation point of view for such structures, further exploration can be on effective and cheaper way of fabricating larger size particles. And the ultimate goal should be their incorporation and test in real thin c-Si solar cells. Note that such structures cannot be expected to be full replacement of traditional texturization-based light trapping structure. However, more unique and advanced shape of nanoparticles can be explored with emphasis on cheaper and easier fabrication methods for further light trapping enhancements.

For ﬁnding the optimum arrangement of nanoparticles at back and corresponding evaluation of the cell performance, study can be done where incident light angle varies as the sun moves in the sky in real scenario. 10.3 Reﬂection Reduction Required for a Wide Range of Angle of Incidence and Compatibility of Different Light Tapping Structures When we talk about solar cells, ultimately these would be used for making solar modules and later would be installed in the ﬁeld where it would generate electricity from sunlight. Considering earthsun geometry, for a person on earth, the sun moves from east to west and sunlight would fall on cells at different angles starting from sunrise in the east till sunset in the west. In relative motion, we can assume that the sun is moving around the earth. A spherical coordinate system may be used for suns position with respect to earth as shown in Fig. 10.3. In different seasons, the distance between sun and earth varies. Also, the angular positions represented by ϴ and / would vary. Different positions of the sun in the sky in different seasons (e.g., winter, summer, etc.) may result in different angles of incidence and different intensities on the cell. So, for optimizing the cell light trapping structure, the cell design and the light trapping structure should be such that it provides best output from the cell, accounting the variation in angle of light incidence on cell surface also. In laboratory, usually the light trapping structure optimizations are done for Earth Sun r φ θ ( , , ) r θ φ X Y Z Fig. 10.3 Schematic of relative motion between sun and earth in spherical coordinate system 180 10 Future Scope in Advanced Lighting  normal incidence of light. But, such optimized structure would not necessarily be an ideal one which may work for any angle of incidence of light. In this scenario, it becomes evident that we should explore light trapping structure which is optimized for best light trapping performance for a wide range of angle of incidence. Considering the constant light intensity, one can explore the impact of angle of incidence on light trapping capability for different light trapping structures, espe- cially, the plasmonic-based light trapping structures which have got recent attention and are in early phase of development. Research can be focused where cells can have different optimized light trapping structures. For comparison of different angles of light incidence (ϴ and / combinations, as shown in Fig. 10.4.) of opti- mized light trapping structure, cumulative power generation from the cell should be compared which accounts the overall cell performance for all angle of incidence as in real scenario as discussed above. Such study can be proved beneﬁcial consid- ering the importance of angle-dependent reﬂection behavior from cell surface and impact on cell performance. Upcoming plasmonic-based advanced light trapping structures as well as the other existing light trapping structures compatibility for reﬂection reduction in a wide range of angle of incidence can be proposed. Some research and publications can be found in this direction. For example, Spinelli et al. (2012) had reported a study on angle-dependent specular reﬂectance from base silicon wafer, silicon coated with 60 nm silicon nitride anti-reﬂecting layer and silicon nanoparticles coated with 60 nm silicon nitride anti-reﬂecting layer. Figure 10.5 shows the measured specular reﬂectance for different angles of incidence for light of wave- length 632 nm. In their study (Spinelli et al. 2012), the ﬁnding was that silicon nanoparticle arrays, coated with 60 nm silicon nitride anti-reﬂecting layer, show best Light source r φ θ ( , , ) r θ φ X Y Z Solar cell with diﬀerent light trapping structures Fig. 10.4 Light incidence on test cell with variable angle of incidence (ϴ and /) proposed for light trapping structure capability and compatibility check for a wide range of angle of incidence 10.3 Reﬂection Reduction Required for a Wide Range of Angle  181 anti-reﬂection effect in a wide range of angle of incidence. Since there are very few such publications which show such study, there is a good scope for further research and development in this direction. 10.4 Efﬁcient Light Directors Nanoparticles at front surface of a c-Si solar cell are advantageous in terms of light trapping enhancement, but only for longer wavelengths. High reﬂection in visible wavelength region due to backscattering effect is the main cause of concern as discussed in Sect. 9.5. This can be the focus of future exploration of nanostructure design and development. Light directors, which can be high refractive index based nanostructures or combination of metal and dielectrics, can be explored which could enhance the forward scattering or couple the incident light to active absorbing material. A hypothetical light director from which the expectation could be scat- tering of the light in forward direction is shown in Fig. 10.6. In such case, the Fig. 10.5 Angle-dependent specular reﬂectivity measured for 632 nm light wavelength for bare Si, Si coated with 60 nm silicon nitride anti-reﬂecting layer, and Si nanoparticles coated with 60 nm silicon nitride. a for s-polarized (solid symbols) and p-polarized (open symbols) incident beam; b average of s-polarizations and p-polarizations, plotted on a logarithmic scale (Reprinted by permission from Macmillan Publishers Ltd: [NATURE COMMUNICATIONS] (Spinelli P., Verschuuren M.A., Polman A., Broadband omnidirectional anti-reﬂection coating based on subwavelength surface Mie resonators, 3:692. doi:10.1038/ncomms1691, (2012)) c-Si solar cell Light Light Director Fig. 10.6 Schematic of a hypothetical light director on c-Si solar cell 182 10 Future Scope in Advanced Lighting  minimization of backscattering may be done by coupling the light along the surface which could be re-scattered in forward direction. Such structure should show high forward scattering efﬁciency and negligible backscattering efﬁciency if it is to be considered as efﬁcient light director. At this stage, such assumptions are hypothetical only, but one may think in this direction and can explore various shape and metaldielectric nanostructure combinations for overcoming the backscattering effect as observed in nanoparticles at front case. 10.5 Combination of Multiple Light Trapping Technologies for Enhanced Cell Performance Till now we have discussed many different light trapping structures, starting from dielectric-based anti-reﬂection coating in Chap. 3 and surface texturing with dif- ferent shapes in Chaps. 4 and 5. Also, combination of dielectric coated textured surface has been discussed in Chap. 6 and the plasmonics and Mie scattering based light trapping have been discussed in Chaps. 79. All the designs and light trapping technology were discussed keeping c-Si wafer based solar cell in focus. Each light trapping structure has their advantages as well as disadvantages. However, com- bination of dielectric anti-reﬂection coating with surface texturing greatly inﬂuences the light trapping potential in c-Si solar cells as discussed in Chap. 6. Similarly, other light trapping structures can be combined and explored for next-generation thin c-Si wafer based cells where target is to fabricate efﬁcient solar cells using 100 lm c-Si wafers. As an attempt to replace back surface texturing, as discussed in Sect. 10.2, Eisenlohr et al. (2015) used dielectric spheres (silicon oxide) at back in combination of dielectric coated textured front surface. A representative device schematic can be seen in Fig. 10.2. Similar research and development can be planned for combination of other Mie scatterer or plasmonic-based light trapping structures. Figure 10.7 shows some representative schematics as proposed combi- nation of light trapping structures for c-Si solar cell applications. The representative light trapping structure schematic is shown in Fig. 10.7a, where metal and/or dielectric nanoparticles at front and back may be used and can be explored for thinner c-Si solar cells. In this case, of course, the back reﬂection from front nanoparticles would create problem. However, different designs and shapes of nanostructures can be explored. Further, the representative light trapping structure schematic as shown in Fig. 10.7b, where DMD anti-reﬂection structures at front and metal and/or dielectric nanoparticles at back are shown, can be explored for broadband anti-reﬂection effects in thin c-Si wafer based cells. Developments toward nano-pyramids/nano-textures fabrication and its relative impact on thin c-Si wafer based cell performance can also be explored. Use of nano-textures/nano-sized pyramids may give comparatively less surface recombi- nation effects compared to traditionally used large-size texture pyramids (5 10 lm). However, a comparative study would be needed to conﬁrm the relative 10.4 Efﬁcient Light Directors 183 gain or loss for such nano-textures/nano-sized pyramids shapes. Also, combination of metal/dielectric nanostructures with such nano-textures surfaces can be evaluated in terms of electrical performance enhancement of the cell. In summary, there are lots of scope for further research which can be done for individual light trapping structures and combination of different light trapping structures. It would be worthwhile to explore the impact of the combination of such light trapping structures on light trapping capability when exploring the discussed individual light trapping structures. At the end, the preferred structure would be one which would provide better light trapping and would involve relatively lesser cost for fabrication. 10.6 Advanced Light Trapping Structure Implementation in Next-Generation Solar Cells Since the ﬁrst c-Si solar cell made in 1941, there has been continuous effort to make the cell with better performance. There have been continuous efforts toward improving Si material quality, metal contacts, etc. as well as improvements in making cheaper and easy to use process technologies. In 1974, efforts toward improving the light trapping in Si-based cell came into light when COMSAT laboratories introduced surface texturing concept which we have already discussed in Chap. 2.

It has been emphasized many times in the book that the next-generation c-Si would require thinner c-Si wafer as substrate to maintain the cost reduction trend of the cell manufacturing. There have been many developments and a lot more to come in regards to manufacturing of thinner c-Si wafers. Both bottom-up and top-down approaches are being considered and being researched to make cheaper and cost-competitive cells (Martini et al. 2014; Terheiden et al. 2015; Teplin et al. 2015; Jain et al. 2015). Depending upon the wafer thickness, cell fabrication process may vary and many other challenges would appear. Now, as we move toward thinner c-Si wafer based cell technology, one requirement is for sure is the back surface passivation. When cell thickness reduces, the back surface recombination becomes critical and it greatly inﬂuences the open-circuit voltage (Voc) and quantum efﬁ- ciency (Q.E) of the cell at longer wavelengths. Figure 10.8 shows a representative image for a basic back surface passivated thin c-Si solar cell. Just addition of dielectric surface passivation layer at back would inﬂuence the process sequence and also the optimized condition for the appropriate light trapping structure. For example, the light reaching till back would not directly get reﬂected from SiAl interface and the presence of dielectric would inﬂuence the front escape of the light. This is just an example as how this would change the optimization of the light trapping structure and a re-optimization of the existing light trapping structure may be required. There may be many other additional requirements. There is the pos- sibility that the discussed noble and advanced light trapping structure prove to be more advantageous than what we predict today. However, all these would only be clear once the light trapping structures are optimized and then implemented in real solar cells and proper comparative study is done. In summary, the aim of future research and development should be toward optimization of the individual light trapping structures and comparative study focusing on the cell electrical performance parameters and not just the reﬂection and absorption proﬁle. Also, one should keep in mind the end device structure while doing the comparative light trapping performance study for a particular light trapping design. Note that such study would be of comparison for the two designs c-Si PV cell Light trapping structure with front passivaƟon layer Back contact Dielectric Front contact Contact fired through passivation layer Back passivation layer Fig. 10.8 Schematic of a representative basic back surface passivated thin c-Si solar cell 10.6 Advanced Light Trapping Structure Implementation  185 and hence one should be very careful in designing the experiments and in analyzing the data. At the end, the choice of light trapping structure and design would depend on its easy to use the method and relative gain in cell performance in terms of power produced per unit cent spent in manufacturing the cell.
