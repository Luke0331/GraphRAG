Prior to design the ARC coatings, a method to determine the refractive index of single layer thin films deposited on silicon substrates, utilizing experimental reflectance data were devised and later used for ARC designing purpose. For refractive index calculation, this method relies on two steps: the first step includes the calculation of extinction coefficient values from the reflection and transmission spectra of films on corning 1737 substrates and later using these calculated extinction coefficient values for fitting the reflectance data of the films on silicon substrate. The experimentally observed average reflectance (Ravg) (400 nm  λ  1100 nm) was 10.95% for the ITO SLARC and 4.39% for the SiO2/TiO2 DLARC on silicon substrate. A strong correlation was observed between the theoretically predicted and experimentally measured reflectance spectra of the fabricated ARCs. Subsequently, these refractive indices (n) and extinction coefficient (k) values were used to simulate the performance silicon solar cells under different ARC conditions using TCAD Sentaurus. The analysis of different performance parameters includes open-circuit voltage (VOC), short-circuit current density (JSC), reflectance, external quantum efficiency (EQE), and photovoltaic efficiency. The results indicated the superiority of DLARC (SiO2/TiO2) based devices which achieved a maximum efficiency of 20.35%, compared to 18.40% for ITO SLARC and 13.54% for devices without any ARC. 1 Introduction Crystalline Silicon-based solar cells have gained sig- nificant attention as an excellent and cost-effective means for harnessing solar energy. Its domination in the market is due to the high abundance and mature manufacturing technologies with good power con- version efficiencies. However, the reflection losses from the Silicon-based solar cells severely cripple the device efficiency. Anti-reflection coatings (ARC) are Received: 16 October 2024 Accepted: 17 April 2025 Published online: 24 April 2025  The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature, 2025 Address correspondence to E-mail: pratima@iitg.ac.in J Mater Sci: Mater Electron (2025) 36:721 721 Page 2 of 14 the most effective means to reduce reflection losses and improve the devices efficiency [1, 2]. Various ARCs have been optimized theoretically and experimentally to reduce the optical losses in silicon solar cells. [311] Interference-type ARCs especially Single Layer ARC and Double Layer ARC are the most commonly used type in Solar cells. These ARC coatings reduce reflection by the concept of phase changes in light and the dependence of the reflectivity on the refractive index [12]. Among the materials studied, oxides such as SiO2, MgO, AZO, SnO2, and TiO2 have been thoroughly investigated and optimized for ARC applications in silicon-based solar cells [13, 14]. SiO2 and TiO2 are known for their excellent stability, mechanical hardness, and minimal absorption in the 400 nm-1100 nm wavelength range, owing to their wide bandgap nature. Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) is another widely used transparent conducting oxide as electrode in solar cells due to its high optical band gap (3.54.3 eV), high optical transmissivity ( 85%), low sheet resistance, and stability [15]. Consequently, ITO, TiO2, and SiO2 were selected for fabricating ARCs on silicon substrates using the RF sputtering technique. The optical characteristics of these filmssuch as thickness, absorption coefficient, and refractive indexplays a crucial role in determining their performance and functionality as an ARC in the silicon-based solar cells. Therefore, it is necessary to comprehend and precisely measure these optical parameters to maximize the effectiveness in devices. Widely used methods, such as the Swanepoel method or Transfer-matrix method (TMM) [1618], rely on the presence of interference fringes in transmission spectra or reflection spectra [19]. Interference fringes typically occur only in films with sufficient thickness, which poses a significant limitation when working with the thin films commonly used in solar cell ARC application or emitter layer applications for silicon heterojunction solar cells. The thicknesses required for ARC application or emitter layer application in solar cells are usually significantly lower than the one required for yielding interference fringes. This constraint can result in inaccuracies in designing and fabricating anti-reflection coatings (ARCs) and in determining the refractive index of new materials for silicon heterojunction solar cells. To address this issue, we have developed a new method for determining the refractive index of films deposited on non-transparent substrates, such as silicon. Unlike widely used methods, our approach can work without the need of interference fringes, making it suitable for designing ARCs and determining the refractive index of new materials. The experimentally obtained reflectance spectra of ITO, TiO2 and SiO2 ARC films deposited on silicon substrates were analyzed and fitted against our theoretical proposed reflectance model to obtain the optical constants of the films. The optical parameters obtained through our proposed method showed strong agreement with previously published data. Subsequently, Single Layer ARC (SLARC) of ITO, TiO2, SiO2 and SiO2-TiO2 Double Layer ARC (DLARC) were designed theoretically and then fabricated on silicon substrates. The experimentally measured reflectance spectra of the fabricated ARCs closely match with the theoretical predictions. Notably, the SiO2TiO2 DLARC demonstrated a significant reduction in average reflectance (Ravg = 4.39%) compared to ITO (Ravg = 10.95%), TiO2 (Ravg = 14.97%), and SiO2 (Ravg = 16.07%) SLARCs within the 400nm-1100nm wavelength range. Using the derived refractive index and extinction coefficient values alongside the measured ARC layer thicknesses, influence of ITO SLARC and SiO2-TiO2 DLARC on the performance parameters such as the short-circuit current density (JSC), open-circuit voltage (VOC), External quantum efficiency (EQE), and conversion efficiency of the silicon-based solar cells were studied using TCAD sentaurus. Additionally, the experimentally measured reflection spectra of ITO SLARC and SiO2-TiO2 DLARC were correlated with their corresponding simulated EQE curves to provide deeper insights into the underlying physics. 2 Experimental and simulation details 2.1 Optical model for refractive index calculation from a single layer thin filmsubstrate system An optical model also known as multiple reflectance model is represented in Fig. 1 for the air/thin film/sub- strate assembly with d as the thickness of the thin film. The resultant amplitude reflection coefficient can now be written as J Mater Sci: Mater Electron (2025) 36:721 Page 3 of 14 721 where, r01 is the reflection amplitude coefficient from Air (0)/Thin film (1) interface, r12 is the reflection amplitude coefficient from thin film (1)/substrate (2) interface, t01 is the transmission amplitude coefficient from Air (0)/thin film (1) interface, t10 is the transmission amplitude coefficient from thin film (1)/ Air (0) interface, and the phase lag term ( 휷) is given by 휷= 2흅dncos(휽1) 흀 Upon simplification, this infinite series can be written as 2.2 Extension to multilayers assemblies The overall reflection for a multilayer ARC assembly can also be calculated from the method prescribed by Hiroyuki Fujiwara [15]. Figure 2 shows an assembly consisting of two thin layers formed on a substrate. At first, the reflection amplitude coefficient for layer2(2) and the substrate (3) are calculated using Eqs. 2. (Fig. 3).

The layer 2(2) and substrate are then replaced by equivalent layer named (layer 2(2) + substrate (3)) accompanied by their equivalent reflection amplitude coefficient r123 as dem- onstrated in Fig. 4. This calculation methodology allows us to simplify the Double layer assembly (DLARC) to a single layer ARC assembly (SLARC), where Eqs. 2 can be used to calculate the reflection and transmission amplitude coefficients for the whole system. The phase lag term (β1) is given by 훽1 = 2휋d1n1푐표푠(휃1) 휆 , where d1 and n1 are the thickness and refractive index of the first layer. Similarly, this method can be extended to Triple layer ARC (TLARC) and, beyond that, by performing the calculations upward from the substrate. 2.3 TCAD simulation details To thoroughly investigate the effects of different ARCs, silicon solar cells (Fig. 5a) under different ARC Conditions were simulated using TCAD Sentaurus. The parameters used for device simulation are listed in Table 1. The simulation parameters were carefully selected to closely match the experimental observed ones in our studies for silicon-based solar cell. This approach allows us to predict device performance under realistic conditions and provides a way to demonstrate the significance of the reduced reflection losses for photovoltaic research community. For optical modelling of the device, a complex refractive model is used (4) r0123 = r01 + r123 exp (i2훽1 ) 1 + r01r123 exp (i2훽1 ) (5) n = n(𝜆) + ik(𝜆) Fig. 4 Schematic diagram for Air(0)/ Layer 1(1) / equivalent layer (layer 2(2) + substrate (3)) structure Fig. 5 Schematic a diagram of the silicon-based solar cell with ARC b energy band diagram of the device J Mater Sci: Mater Electron (2025) 36:721 Page 5 of 14 721 In the complex refractive index model, n(휆) is the real part and k(휆) is the imaginary part of the refractive index, called as extinction coefficient. The calculated k(휆) values for films deposited at corning substrates, alongside the experimental refractive index ( n(휆) ) values obtained from fitting of multiple reflectance model for ITO, TiO2 and SiO2 films deposited on sili- con substrate were used during the simulation studies for integrating different ARC structures in the silicon solar cell. The light absorbed by the absorber layer in a solar cell is largely determined by the fraction of light transmitted through the anti-reflection coating (ARC), which is governed by the refractive index (n) and the extinction coefficient (k) of the ARC material. 2.4 Experimental details Thin films of ITO, SiO2, and TiO2 were deposited on P-type crystalline silicon wafer (resistivity 15 mΩ cm, thickness 300 µm, single side polished, CZ) and boro- silicate glass (Corning1737) using Sputtering system.

The target to substrate dis- tance was kept fixed at 5.5cm for all materials during deposition. The deposition parameters including the substrate temperatures used for deposition of the differ- ent ARC materials have been optimized to get optimal transmission values and minimum absorption losses and are listed in Table 2. The thickness measurement of the deposited films on both the substrates were car- ried using a profilometer (Vecco Dektak 150). Optical measurements such as reflectance and transmittance in 400-1100nm range of the ARCs films were measured using Perkin Elmer Lambda 950 spectrophotometer. The reflectance measurement were done in URA (universal reflectance accessory) mode. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed using Rigaku, SmartLab equipped with CuKα-radiation of 1.54 Å. Field Emission Scanning Elec- tron Microscope (FESEM) [ZEISS, Sigma 300] was used to examine the surface morphology of ARC films. For multilayer fabrication, SiO2-TiO2 DLARC is fabricated using similar deposition conditions as used during sin- gle layer depositions of the films. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Xray diffraction analysis (XRD) The XRD spectra for the sputtered films on corning glass are illustrated in Fig. 6. Figure 6a presents the diffraction pattern for the sputtered ITO films, which matches well with the diffraction pattern for the (211), (222), (400), (322), (431), (440), and (622) orientations of bixbyite structure [1924]. Fig. 6b shows the diffraction peaks for TiO2 film at 2Ɵ = 27.55 (110) and 54.23 (211). The above-mentioned features in the diffraction pattern for TiO2 films confirm the existence of TiO2 in its Rutile phase [17, 18, 25]. Martinez et al. (2006) reported an amorphous peak at 2θ = 23 for SiO2 prepared through a solgel procedure. In our work (Fig. 6c), the amorphous SiO2 peak was found at 2θ = 23.7, which is in good agreement with the above-reported values.[26, 27]. Later, deposition rates of these films on corning sub- strate were estimated and listed in Table 2. These depo- sition rates were then utilized to deposit thin films of comparable thicknesses on corning substrate required for fabricating ARCs. Subsequently, these are used to Fig. 7 Measured a Transmittance spectra (T) and b Reflectance spectra (R) for different thin films deposited at the corning sub- strate. These data are utilized to determine the extinction coef- ficient values for the films providing insight into the absorption losses of the films Fig. 8 Calculated extinction coefficient values as function of wavelength for different ARC films deposited at corning substrate J Mater Sci: Mater Electron (2025) 36:721 Page 7 of 14 721 measure the transmission and reflection spectra and cal- culate these films extinction coefficient values. 3.2 Transmission and reflection spectra analysis Reflection (R) and transmission (T) spectra were used to calculate the absorption spectra of the films [28]. Since the Silicon substrate is opaque to 400nm-1100nm wavelength range, measuring the transmission spec- tra of the deposited films on silicon is not possible. Therefore, a Corning substrate, which is transparent, was chosen alongside the silicon substrate for film deposition. This allows for the measurement of both transmission and reflection spectra, which can then be used to calculate the absorbance ( A ) spectra and Fig. 9 The FESEM images of deposited a ITO, b TiO2, c SiO2 films on a silicon substrate alongside with d corning glass, e silicon sub- strate J Mater Sci: Mater Electron (2025) 36:721 721 Page 8 of 14 extinction coefficient ( k ) of the deposited films. Using the deposition rates listed in Table 2 for corning sub- strate, thin films of ITO, TiO2 and SiO2 were deposited on corning substrate with thicknesses of  74nm,47nm and 100nm, respectively. Figure 7a and b represent the measured reflectance and transmittance spectra of the thin films of ITO, TiO2 and SiO2 on corning substrate. 3.3 Extinction coefficient calculation The absorbance (A) of the thin films was calculated according to the relation below where R and T are the transmission spectra for the films deposited on corning substrate. The expression for extinction coefficient and absorption coefficient are given by [8] where λ and d are the corresponding photon wave- length and thickness of the film in nm, respectively. The extinction coefficient values as a function of wave- length is shown in Fig. 8. 3.4 FESEM analysis The FESEM images (Fig. 9) shows that the surface of the deposited films on silicon substrate is uniform, and no signature of pin holes or cracks are detected. These kinds of surface morphology are essential for ARC applications. 3.5 Refractive index calculation for films on silicon substrate For the refractive index calculations, thin films of ITO, TiO2 and SiO2 are deposited films on Si substrate with thicknesses of  100nm, 45nm and 100nm, respec- tively. Deposition rates are calculated for these films on silicon substrates from these measured thicknesses.

A good fit is obtained as shown in Fig. 10ac. The refractive index as a function of wavelength is shown in Fig. 10d. To further validate the obtained refractive index values, Swanepoel method is used for determining the refractive index values for films (ITO-367nm, TiO2-80 nm, SiO2-100nm) deposited on corning sub- strate using interference fringes present in the trans- mittance spectra and is tabulated in Table 3. Figure 11 shows the transmittance spectra of the ITO, TiO2 and SiO2 films on corning substrate. Fringes in the trans- mittance spectra SiO2 films were not observed as SiO2 and Corning Glass have nearly similar refractive index values and therefore obtaining the interference pattern is not possible. While using the Swanepoel method, the corning substrate is assumed to be transparent and non-dispersive, with absorption coefficient (α) equals to zero. The refractive index for air and glass substrate is n0 = 1 and ns = 1.5. The refractive index values obtained from both approaches are reasonably good, which confirms the validity of our approach, as presented in Table 3. The obtained Refractive index alongside with the extinction coefficient values and deposition rates of these films for silicon substrate were then utilized in designing and fabricating Single Layer ARCs (SLARC) and Double Later ARCs (DLARC) for silicon substrate. 3.6 Experimental fabrication of SLARC The optimal design for a single layer ARC (SLARC) on silicon substrate requires the physical thickness of ARC layer to be λ0/4n. The ideal refractive index of the ARC layer can be calculated using the following formula where n0,n1 and ns are the refractive indices of the incident medium, ARC layer, substrate ( ns = 4.087 at 550nm), respectively. The SLARCs are often engineered to exhibit lowest reflection at the design wavelength λ0 = 550nm, which is also the photon flux peak in the solar spectrum. To achieve this, the coating should possess Quarter wavelength thickness such that the reflected wave from the SLARCs top surface is out of phase, with the wave reflected from the ARC-Substrate interface. Their interference becomes destructive in nature around the design wavelength (550 nm). The resulting destructive interference at the design wavelength (550 nm) effectively reduces reflectivity to near zero. Equation 8. gives the optimal (8) n1 = n0ns Table 3 The refractive index values for different ARC materials obtained through the Swanepoel method and multiple reflection model for different ARC materials ARC Materials Refractive index derived from fitting using Multiple reflection model for thin films (Silicon Substrate) Refractive index derived from Swanepoel method (corning Substrate) Deposition rate(nm/min) on Silicon substrate ITO 2.16 (550nm) 2.01 (550nm) 12.02 TiO2 2.57 (486nm) 2.47 (486nm) 0.46 SiO2 1.42 (550nm)  0.44 Fig. 11 Transmittance spectra (T) of different films showcas- ing interference fringes deposited on corning substrate where Swanepoel analysis is employed to determine the refractive index values using these fringes J Mater Sci: Mater Electron (2025) 36:721 721 Page 10 of 14 refractive value to be around 2.021 for the SLARC layer which is close to the calculated refractive index for ITO films [8]. Figure 12 shows the measured reflectance spectra for different SLARCs fabricated on Si substrates using rf sputtering technique. Deposition rates of these films on silicon substrate (listed in Table 3) are used during the time of deposition to get the films of desired thick- ness. The thicknesses of the ARC layers on the Silicon Substrate were found to be 67 nm (ITO SLARC),60 nm (TiO2 SLARC), and 95 nm (SiO2 SLARC), which are close to ideal values (λ0/4n) listed in Table 4. The sim- ulations were performed using the measured thick- nesses of the ARC films. The experimental and simu- lated results show good agreement with each other. Out of the fabricated SLARCs, ITO SLARC displayed the best Anti-reflection performance with Ravg = 8.17% and reflection minima of 0.16% at 552nm wavelength. The Ravg values for TiO2 and SiO2 SLARCS were found to be 14.97% and 16.07%, with reflection minima of 6.36% and 9.82% at 584nm and 556nm, respectively. The slight variation between the observed and simu- lated results could be a result of some variation in the thickness of the films. The fabricated SiO2 and TiO2 SLARCs have relatively poor Anti-reflection performance because of the significant difference in the refractive index value from the ideal one ( n 2.021). However, with the ITO SLARC, the anti-reflection performance was noticeably better than the other fabricated SLARCs because of ITO films refractive index being close to the ideal refractive index value. 3.7 Experimental fabrication of DLARC To design the double-layer ARC, the thickness of each layer must be of quarter-wave thickness. Theoretically, the ARC layers ideal refractive indices can be calculated as where,n1 and n2 are the refractive indices of layer 1 and layer 2 of DLARC, respectively. SiO2 and TiO2 were chosen to form the DLARC layers as the refractive index values are in accordance to the Eq. 9. The thicknesses and the Theoretical and experimental Ravg values for the SiO2-TiO2 DLARC are tabulated below (Table 5). Figure 13 represents the measured reflection spec- tra for the SiO2TiO2 DLARC alongside the simulated reflection spectra. Simulation were done for measured thicknesses of deposited films. The measured thick- ness for the SiO2 and TiO2 layers is 92 nm and 52 nm, respectively and are close to ideal thickness values.

The reflection losses from bare silicon substrate is about 3545% in the 400nnm-1100nnm range which eventually severely cripple the efficiency of the solar cell. The impact of high reflection losses from the bare silicon substrate are also reflected in the EQE and J-V characteristics of silicon solar cell under no ARC condition. The maxi- mum EQE value never went above 65% due to high reflection losses from c-Si surface, resulting in low short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 26.03 mA/cm2 and efficiency of only 13.54% under no ARC conditions. For ITO SLARC, Fig. 14a, it can be observed that the reflections losses are significantly lower when compared to bare silicon substrate in the 400 nm1100 nm wavelength region and its effect on the performance parameters can be understood from the EQE curve of the device. The simulated EQE curve predicts improvement in the collection of photogenerated carriers throughout the 400 nm1100nmn wavelength region reaching a maximum value of 95% around the virtually zero reflection region around 550 nm. Since the incident photon flux of the solar spectrum is maximum around 550 nm, the virtually zero reflection region around 550 nm ensures efficient absorption of the solar spectrum by the absorber layer. As a result, JSC of the device improved from 26.03 mA/cm2 to 35.15 mA/cm2, while the efficiency improved from 13.54% to 18.79%. As shown in Fig. 14a, the reflectance from SiO2-TiO2 DLARC is significantly lower than that of ITO SLARC throughout the wavelength region of 4001100 nm, except for a narrow wavelength region around 550 nm where the ITO SLARC pre- sents lower reflectance than SiO2-TiO2 DLARC. For SiO2-TiO2 DLARC, the simulated EQE shows significant improvement in the 600 nm-1100 nm Table 4 The measured and predicted Ravg and Rmin values of the fabricated (a) ITO (b) TiO2 (c) SiO2 SLARCs Simulated Ravg % (400nm-1100nm) Experimental Ravg % (400nm-1100nm) Experimental RMIN % and corresponding λ Calculated Ideal thickness Measured thicknesses ITO 9.93 10.95 0.16 (552nm) 64.25 nm 67 nm  3 nm TiO2 13.20 14.97 6.36 (584nm) 53.50 nm 60 nm  5 nm SiO2 16.16 16.07 9.82 (556nm) 95.48 nm 95 nm  4 nm Table 5 The measured and predicted Ravg values of the fabricated SiO2-TiO2 DLARC Theoretical calculated ideal Quarter wave thickness Experimentally measured layer thickness Simulated Ravg % (400 nm1100 nm) Experimental Ravg % (400 nm1100 nm) Layer 1SiO2 ( n1) 95.48 nm 92 nm 3.33 4.39 Layer 2TiO2 ( n2) 55.89 nm 52 nm Fig. 13 The measured vs simulated reflection spectra for the measured thickness of SiO2-TiO2 DLARC on silicon substrate J Mater Sci: Mater Electron (2025) 36:721 721 Page 12 of 14 wavelength range reaching a maximum value of 99% around minima-2(680 nm). However, in spite of significant reduced reflection losses in this region a nominal improvement around minima-1(440 nm) as well as in the  500 nm wavelength range is expected when compared to the ITO SLARC condition. This may be because of the poor photon flux of the solar spectrum in this wavelength range. The efficiency and Jsc improved from 18.79 to 20.35% and 35.15 mA/ cm2 to 38.48 mA/cm2. The performance parameters of the simulated devices are tabulated in Table 6. From Table 6, it can be concluded that SiO2-TiO2 DLARC utilises the incident solar spectrum more efficiently than in the other cases. Table 7 presents the comparison of average reflectance values for previously reported SLARCs and DLARCs over the 4001100 nm wavelength range. The averaged reflectance value for the ITO SLARC and SiO2-TiO2 DLARC reported in this work are lower in the 400nm1100 nm wavelength range when compared to the experimental reported Ravg values in the literature and is summarized in Table 7. Furthermore, the SLARCs and DLARCs were designed using the calculated refractive index values for the films using our algorithm, reinforcing the validity and versatility of our approach. Apart from the ARCs designing, the obtained refractive index values for the films can be used to get valuable insights into their properties [3234]. 4 Conclusions In summary, the optical parameters for the depos- ited films were obtained through Multiple Reflection Model fitting of the reflection spectra of these films deposited on silicon substrate. These refractive index data were then used to design and fabricate ITO SLARC, SiO2 SLARC, TiO2 SLARC, and SiO2-TiO2 DLARC for silicon substrates using the RF sputtering technique.

These findings validate the accuracy and reliability of the proposed model. It is further realized that the anti-reflection performance of DLARCs is way better than that of SLARCs. The Ravg value for the fabricated SiO2TiO2 DLARC was experimentally observed to be 4.39% when compared to ITO (Ravg = 10.95%), TiO2 (Ravg = 14.97%) and SiO2 (Ravg = 16.07%) SLARCS in the 400 nm-1100nmn wavelength range. Impact of ITO SLARC and SiO2TiO2 DLARC was investigated using TCAD Sentaurus. Analysis of the performance parameters of the simulated device revealed a rela- tionship between reduced reflectance values and devices efficiency. The enhanced EQE for ITO SLARC and SiO2TiO2 DLARC devices suggested a significant contribution of Jsc in efficiency improvement. A wider low reflection band resulted in a much-improved EQE and higher short-circuit current density values for the SiO2TiO2 DLARC device. As a result, the devices efficiency increased from 13.54% (no ARC) to 20.35% (SiO2-TiO2 DLARC).
