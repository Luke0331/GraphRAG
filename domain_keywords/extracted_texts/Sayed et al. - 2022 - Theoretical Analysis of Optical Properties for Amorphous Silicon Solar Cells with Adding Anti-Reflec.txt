The current improvement is justiﬁed by adding the single-period of ternary 1D photonic crystal with texturing on the top surface, which acts as an anti-reﬂecting coating. The texturing shape gives the photons at least two chances to localize inside the active area of the cell. Therefore, it increases the absorbance of the cell. Moreover, we add binary one-dimensional photonic crystals with the features of a photonic band gap, which acts as a back mirror to return the photons that were transmitted inside the cells active region. The considered structure is demonstrated by the well-deﬁned ﬁnite element method (FEM) by using COMSOL multiphysics.

Introduction The photovoltaic effect is the conversion of light into energy by a solar cell, which is a two-terminal semiconducting device. Despite the fact that the phenomena has been known for more than a century [1], its uses and inﬂuence remained limited due to its initial high cost when compared to other alternatives such as oil and nuclear power plants. In 1954, Chapin et al. built the ﬁrst solar cells with a six percent efﬁciency using crystalline silicon technology [2]. Since then, Si technology has been regarded as the PV markets black horse [36]. Furthermore, Si-based PV technology accounts for between 80% and 90% of the market; however, it is anticipated that c-Si PV panels market share will decline from 92% in 2014 to 44.8% in 2030 [7]. The low efﬁciency of silicon solar cells pushed researchers to limit power dissipation by using an artiﬁcial material, which is known as photonic crystal (PCs) [8]. PCs are artiﬁcially created inhomogeneous structures with periodic changes in re- fractive indices in one dimension and a homogeneous in the other two dimensions, and are classiﬁed as 1D-PCs, 2D-PCs, and 3D-PCs [912]. PCs alter the propagation of inci- dent electromagnetic waves in several ways [13,14]. The use of 1D-PCs is widespread in several applications owing to its low cost, ease of fabrication, and high control of the electromagnetic wave localization. Therefore, it is used in water desalination [15], wave guides, sensors [16,17], and advanced optical devices. Additionally, 1D-PCs can be essential for improving solar cell efﬁciency [18,19]. Numerous PC topologies were demonstrated as a result, with the aim of decreasing the reﬂectance of a silicon surface for solar cell applications [20,21]. Recently, researchers Photonics 2022, 9, 813. https://doi.org/10.3390/photonics9110813 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/photonics Photonics 2022, 9, 813 2 of 15 and scientists devoted their efforts to limiting the power dissipation in silicon solar cells to enhance the conversion efﬁciency by using photonic crystals [2224]. Due to the high contrast between silicon and air, most of the incident electromagnetic waves are reﬂected from the silicons top surface, wherein the reﬂectivity of amorphous silicon reaches 35%, as reported by Sprafke et al. [25]. Additionally, without any anti-reﬂection coating, the National Renewable Energy Center (CENER) used a chemical approach to alter the surface morphology of amorphous silicon that is texturized with inverted pyramids: the reﬂectivity is increased to 16%, as demonstrated by Anderson et al. [26]. Furthermore, surface texturing for thin-ﬁlm silicon solar cells was a focus of research in recent decades [27]. Therefore, the structure of PCs is immersed between air and the silicon cell as an anti-reﬂection coating (ARC) to degrade the refractive index and increase the absorbance of the cell. For a more practical procedure, physical vapor oblique angle deposition (PV-OAD) in an electron bombardment evaporator reactor could be used to create the 1D-PCs at room temperature [2830]. The thicknesses of layers are regulated by adjusting the evaporation rate, which ranges from 1 to 1.5 (ÅS1). ITO glass and a Si (100) wafer are both ﬂat substrates that are positioned at a zenithal evaporation angle (α) of 70in relation to the evaporation source. In order to construct the structure with a texturing morphology, the substrate is rotated by 180 degrees around the azimuthal axis (φ) every 500 nm until the required thickness is reached. The multilayer structure is then deposited under similar circumstances. Between each layer, the substrate is additionally azimuthally rotated by 180 degrees [31]. The goal of this research is to develop simple and efﬁcient structures for each anti- reﬂection coating (ARC) and back reﬂector that improves the optical characteristics of a-si solar cells. To begin, ARC structures are made up of texturing ternary 1D-PCs for one period, as the texturing shape gives the photons at least two chances to localize inside the active area of the cell. Moreover, texturing surfaces increase the absorbance at different incident angles in contrast to planner ternary PCs. Then, we design 1D-PCs with the concept of photonic band gap (PBG) to deal with the leakage photons within the electronic energy gap of the hydrogenated amorphous silicon solar cell (Eg = 1.7 ev), which represents the photons from 350 nm to 730 nm. In Section 2, we provide a basic review of theoretical modelling. The numerical results and conclusions are then explained separately. 2. Modeling and Simulation In this part, we are concerned with the designed structure to trap all of the incident electromagnetic waves in the visible spectrum to generate electronhole pairs to produce electricity. Firstly, we study the fundamental concepts of the geometry of the structure and its effect on light trapping. Then, we show a brief theoretical and simulation model with the COMSOL multiphysics program, which is based on the fundamentals of the ﬁnite element method (FEM). Here, Figure 1 represents the considered structure of the hydrogenated amorphous silicon (H: a-Si) solar cell with a modiﬁcation in each anti-reﬂection coating and back reﬂector. Also, in Figure 2, we illustrate the path of the photon inside the texturing surface to localize in the active area of the cell, wherein the shape of the pyramid gives the photons at least two chances to localize on the active layer of the cell. Therefore, the absorption characteristics of the solar cell in the presence of an anti-reﬂective coating on the cells top surface could be investigated using wave optics and semiconductor modules, which is expected to decrease the reﬂectivity and increase the absorbance of the cell as in Equation (1) [32,33]. A(λ) = 1 T(λ) R(λ) (1) where T(λ), and R(λ) are the transmittance and reﬂectance as a function of incident wavelength, respectively. Additionally, it is necessary to solve the Poisson (Equation (2)) and continuity (Equations (3) and (4)) equations in order to estimate the electrostatic Photonics 2022, 9, 813 3 of 15 potential, electron concentration n (cm3), and hole concentration p (cm3) as functions of space [33,34]. (εsφ) = ρ (2) n t 1 qJn + Un = 0 (3) p t 1 qJh + Uh = 0 (4) where εs and ρ are the semiconductor permittivity and space charge density, respectively, q is the electron charge, (Jn, Jh) are current densities [A/cm2], and Un, Uh are the net number of electrons and holes recombined in the unit of time and volume [1/ Scm3 ]. P = q(n p + NA ND) (5) Un = Rn Gn (6) Uh = Rh Gh (7) where Gn, Rn are the generation and the recombination rates of electrons where in, Gh, Rh are generation and recombination rate of holes, respectively. The active area of the cell consists of the p-region, intrinsic region, and n-region, with thicknesses of 15 nm, 200 nm, and 27 nm, respectively. As seen in Figure 1, this disintegrates into a silicon wafer. For the simulation procedure, the meshing size must be 10 times smaller than the smallest incident wavelength, in order to obtain more accurate results in the ﬁnite element method, as we discuss in our previous work [19]. The simulation meshing parameters are the maximum element size equal to 3  109 (m), minimum element size equal to 1.51  1010 (m), and the maximum element growth rate is 1.3. Figure 1.

Results and Discussion Our results and discussions are displayed through three stages; ﬁrstly, we show the effect of inserting an anti-reﬂection coating above the upper surface of amorphous silicon solar cells on the absorbance of the cell by reducing the amount of reﬂected spectrum. Then, in the second stage, we show the optical properties of the one-dimensional photonic crystals that act as a back reﬂector to the cell. Finally, we show the absorbance of the cell with each anti-reﬂection coating and back reﬂector by changing the incident angle. We also compute the optical generation of electronhole pairs, which indicates the overall efﬁciency of the cell. 3.1. Anti-Reﬂection Coating We design step-index structures to reduce the dielectric contrast between the air and amorphous silicon to reduce the reﬂection spectrum. Here, in Figure 3, we compare 1D binary PCs and ternary PCs in reaching low reﬂectivity at normal incidence. The binary ARC is composed of (AB)N; the A layer is silicon dioxide (SiO2), with thickness (d1 = 54 nm) and refractive index (n1 = 1.46) [35], the B layer is titanium dioxide (TiO2) with d2 = 82 nm and n2 = 2.5 [36], and N equal one period. Also, the ternary ARC is composed of (ACB)N; the A layer is SiO2 with d1 = 54 nm and n1 = 1.46; the C layer is silicon nitride (Si3N4) with d2 = 33 nm and n2 = 2.0167 [37]; the B layer is TiO2 with d3 = 82 nm and n3 = 2.5, and N equal one period.

Hydrogenated amorphous silicon solar cell (a-Si: H) absorption spectrum with anti-reﬂective coating The binary ARC is composed of silicon dioxide deposed on titanium dioxide with thickness 54 nm and 82 nm, respectively. Also, the ternary ARC is composed of silicon nitride with a thickness of 33 nm immersed between silicon dioxide and titanium dioxide with thicknesses 54 nm and 82 nm, respectively. Here, we ﬁnd in the case of 1D ternary PCs, the absorption reaches 80% at an incident wavelength equal to 500 nm, which is higher than the others. Due to the ternary structure, we verify the step-index as the following equation. nair  nSiO2  nSi3N4  nTiO2  naSi Therefore, increasing the number of layers with step-index between the air and amor- phous silicon causes enhancement of the cell absorbance, as shown in Figure 3. However, we still have an effective amount of reﬂective spectrum. Thus, we texture the top surface of the anti-reﬂection coating, as the texturing surface give the photons at least two chances to localize inside the cell, as we discussed previously in Section 2. In Figure 4, we show the absorbance of amorphous silicon solar cells with the opti- mized ternary PCs as in Figure 3, and ternary PCs with added texturing from silicon dioxide on the surface with different heights of the texturing. Here, with height (h) = 25 nm, the absorbance (A) = 87% is enhanced with respect to the ternary planner (A = 80%) at incident wave (λ = 500 nm) as shown; also, the result for h = 50 nm is approximately the same as h = 25 nm. However, by increasing the height to 100 nm, the absorbance is decreased as (A = 77%) at the same incident wavelength. In addition, the absorbance is not affected by changing the width of the texturing. All the last results are at the normal incidence. Therefore, we must study the effect of the incident angle on the cell absorbance, as in the following Section 3.2.

The ternary ARC is composed of silicon nitride with a thickness of 33 nm immersed between silicon dioxide and titanium dioxide with a thickness of 54 nm and 82 nm, respectively. 3.2. Back Reﬂector In the subsection, before we design the back reﬂector, we must calculate the reﬂected and transmitted spectrum from the cell with ARC to determine the effective range of the designed back reﬂector. Thus, Figure 5 shows the reﬂected and transmitted spectrum from the modiﬁed cell in the last subsection by adding the ARC optimum structure. Here, we ﬁnd that the reﬂectivity is very small as to the effect of adding ARC. We also ﬁnd that the photons from 550 nm to 730 nm are transmitted from the cell with a remarkable ratio, as shown. Therefore, we design one-dimensional binary photonic crystals to create a photonic band gap in the range of the transmitted photons from 550 nm to 730 nm. The binary back reﬂector is composed of (AB)N, the A layer is silicon dioxide (SiO2), with thickness (d1 = 40 nm) and refractive index (n1 = 1.46) [32], the B layer is silicon (Si) with d2 = 75 nm and n2 = 3.3 [38,39], and the number of periods (N) equal to 12 periods, as shown in Figure 6. In Figure 6, we ﬁnd that the considered structure allows wavelengths between 350 and 550 nanometers to be transmitted through it, as shown in the p-color ﬁgure. It completely blocks the photons in the wavelengths from 550 nm to 750 nm, as in p-color, which is considered the photonic band gap of the structure, and this is very suitable for our modiﬁed amorphous silicon cell. Therefore, we add the last structure as a back reﬂector of our structure of amorphous silicon with a texturing anti-reﬂection coating.

Photonics 2022, 9, 813 8 of 15 3.3. The Optical Properties of the Cell In this subsection, we study the optical properties of amorphous silicon solar cells with each textured anti-reﬂection coating and one-dimensional photonic crystals as a back reﬂector. In addition, we study the effect of incident angle in the environment of the cell to show the best structure for the cell with high efﬁciency. Finally, we calculate the optical generation rate of electronhole pairs in the active area of the cell. In Figure 7, we notice that the absorbance is enhanced by adding a back reﬂector in the range of photonic bandgap, as in Figure 6. That is why the back reﬂector reﬂects the transmitted photons to localize in the active area, which increases the absorbance of the cell. These are the last results are at the normal incidence, therefore, we study the effect of the incident angle to choose the best structure, as the incident angle is varying during the hours of the day. 300 400 500 600 700 800 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0 Absorption Wavelength [nm] With ternary Texturing ARC only With ternary Texturing ARC & back reflector Figure 7. Hydrogenated amorphous silicon solar cell (a-Si: H) absorption spectrum with ternary anti-reﬂective coating with texturing on the top surface with a height equal to 50 nm. The ternary ARC is composed of silicon nitride with a thickness of 33 nm immersed between silicon dioxide and titanium dioxide with a thickness of 54 nm and 82 nm, respectively. Also, the back reﬂector is composed of silicon dioxide and silicon, with thicknesses of 40 nm and 75 nm, respectively. The number of periods equals 12. In Figure 8, we study the absorbance of the cell at the oblique incident for planner ternary ARC and textured surfaces with different heights (25 nm and 50 nm). The ab- sorbance is decreased by increasing the incident angle for all different structures of ARC, and the difference between the absorbance of the three structures is increased by increasing the incident angle. The best structure for all incident angles is the texturing surface with a height equal to 50 nm, as shown. Therefore, we show in Figure 9 the absorbance of the cell with texturing ARC when the height of the pyramids equals 50 nm. Here, we notice that the absorbance is increased by increasing the incident angle from normal incidence to oblique incidence with an angle of 40 degrees. Also, at an incident angle equal 50 degrees, the absorbance begins to decrease with respect to the normal incident. As a result of its high absorbance at the oblique incident, this structure is more compatible with the environmental silicon solar cell. Thus, the average absorption for our optimized structure Photonics 2022, 9, 813 9 of 15 in the visible spectrum is approximately 95%, which means the average reﬂection is only about 5% without no transmission photons. To highlight the inspiration and innovation of our work, we added Table 1 to compare our current work to the earlier works in the literature review. Hence, we calculate the optical generation rate of this structure to be sure that the absorbed photons are assisting in the generation of electronhole pairs as shown in Figure 10. Finally, we can conclude from the results that changing the surface morphology of the solar cell has a signiﬁcant effect on overall efﬁciency, and it increases efﬁciency at the oblique incidence in comparison to ﬂat surfaces. Texturing and concave surfaces of the solar cell are a promising solution to overcome the low efﬁciency of the commercial cells. 300 400 500 600 700 800 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 H=25 nm H=50 nm Planner Theta = 0 o Absorption 300 400 500 600 700 800 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 Theta = 30 o Absorption 300 400 500 600 700 800 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 Theta = 10 o Absorption 300 400 500 600 700 800 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 Theta = 40 o Absorption 300 400 500 600 700 800 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 Theta = 20 o Absorption Wavelength [nm] 300 400 500 600 700 800 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 Theta = 50 o Absorption Wavelength [nm] Figure 8.

Figure 11 represents the schematic structure of the cell with the two electrodes. From the dispersion relation of indiumtinoxide (ITO) as shown in Figure 12 [43,44], we notice that the extinction coefﬁcient is very low, so it does not affect the incident photons on the active area of the cell when we add it on the interface between the top surface of amorphous silicon and the lower surface of the designed ARC. The refractive index of ITO is approximately similar to the refractive index of O2 (n3 = 2.5). Photonics 2022, 9, 813 11 of 15 As a result, we can replace the layer of TiO2 in the ARC structure with ITO, as shown in Figure 11, to serve as the front contact electrode. Also, we add a 50 nm molybdenum (Mo) electrode to act as a back contact electrode [45]. 300 400 500 600 700 800 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 x 10 25 Optical Genration [m 4* Kg 2/ S 6*A 2] Wavelength [nm] 0 o 10 o 20 o 30 o 40 o 50 o Figure 10.

Here, in Figure 13 we study the optical properties of the considered structure in Figure 11 and compare them with the optical properties of the cell as in Figure 9 in the case of normal incidence. By adding the two electrodes, the absorption of the cell is increasing at the smaller wavelengths, and this adding causes a small difference between the optical properties with and without the two electrodes, as we show in Figure 13. Thus, our Photonics 2022, 9, 813 12 of 15 structure is compatible with the experimental date. At the same time, the ITO layer is acting as a grading index and a front electrode for the cell. Therefore, our modiﬁed structure of the textured ARC is an optimum energy-harvesting solar cell. 300 350 400 450 500 550 600 650 700 750 800 1.85 1.95 2.05 2.15 2.25 2.35 2.35 Refractive index (n) λ [nm] 300 350 400 450 500 550 600 650 700 750 800 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 Extinction Coefficient (K) n K Figure 12.

Conclusions At the end of this study, we ﬁnd that grading refractive index for an anti-reﬂection coating structure achieves high absorbance for the normal incidence. However, it loses this advantage for the oblique incident. Then, adding texturing to the upper surface of the grating refractive index ARC enhances the absorbance owing to the pyramid structure, giving the incident photons at least two chances to localize inside the active area of the cell. Therefore, the texturing surface is a highly trapping structure for all-optical devices, with high efﬁciency owing to its good ability to trap light in normal and oblique incidences. Moreover, we added one-dimensional binary PCs as back reﬂectors to reﬂect the transmitted photons [from 550 nm to 730 nm] within the range of the energy gap of the cell. Finally, by adding texturing ARC and binary one-dimensional PCs back reﬂectors, the absorbance is increased to 97% for the incident angle equal to 30 degrees over a wide range of the visible spectrum. We also calculated the electronhole pair generation at different incident angles in the presence of a texturing anti-reﬂecting coating with a height equal to 50 nm and a back reﬂector. Speciﬁcally, when compared to normal incidence, the optical generation is greatly improved by the oblique incidence of the interacting radiation. Thus, for silicon solar cells, the presence of a texturing anti-reﬂecting coating with a height equal to 50 nm is the most compatible design for catching the majority of incident photons and enhancing cell absorption.
