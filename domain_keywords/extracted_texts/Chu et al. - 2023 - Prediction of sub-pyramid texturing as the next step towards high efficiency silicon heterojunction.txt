Article https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-39342-3 Prediction of sub-pyramid texturing as the next step towards high efﬁciency silicon heterojunction solar cells Feihong Chu1,4, Xianlin Qu2,4, Yongcai He1,3, Wenling Li1, Xiaoqing Chen 1, Zilong Zheng 1 , Miao Yang3, Xiaoning Ru3, Fuguo Peng3, Minghao Qu3, Kun Zheng 1 , Xixiang Xu 3 , Hui Yan1 & Yongzhe Zhang 1 The interfacial morphology of crystalline silicon/hydrogenated amorphous silicon (c-Si/a-Si:H) is a key success factor to approach the theoretical efﬁ- ciency of Si-based solar cells, especially Si heterojunction technology. The unexpected crystalline silicon epitaxial growth and interfacial nanotwins for- mation remain a challenging issue for silicon heterojunction technology. Here, we design a hybrid interface by tuning pyramid apex-angle to improve c-Si/a- Si:H interfacial morphology in silicon solar cells. The pyramid apex-angle (slightly smaller than 70.53) consists of hybrid (111)0.9/(011)0.1 c-Si planes, rather than pure (111) planes in conventional texture pyramid. Employing microsecond-long low-temperature (500 K) molecular dynamic simulations, the hybrid (111)/(011) plane prevents from both c-Si epitaxial growth and nanotwin formation. More importantly, given there is not any additional industrial preparation process, the hybrid c-Si plane could improve c-Si/a-Si:H interfacial morphology for a-Si passivated contacts technique, and wide- applied for all silicon-based solar cells as well. Over the past few decades, silicon wafer-based silicon solar cells have dominated the photovoltaic (PV) industry, given low production cost, high energy-conversion efﬁciency and long-term stability14. The sili- con heterojunction (SHJ) as state-of-the-art technology, is made of silicon wafers employing hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) passivated contacts for both polarities based on i/n and i/p stacks of thin-ﬁlm. In consideration of high open circuit voltage (VOC), SHJ is one of the most promising technologies for achieving high efﬁciency5,6, and the theoretical power conversion efﬁciency (PCE) of SHJ solar cells is 28.6%7. Recently, LONGi has received 26.8% of world record efﬁ- ciency, based on SHJ manufacturing improvements over the years8. The interfacial morphology of the crystalline silicon (c-Si)/a-Si:H het- erojunction is a key success factor in further SHJ efﬁciency improvement9. The a-Si with continuous random network structure, prefers to convert to a well-ordered crystal lattice conﬁguration, and the latter has face-centered cubic and hexagonal close-packed struc- tures; therefore, the c-Si epitaxy and embedded nanotwins are gen- erated at the c-Si/a-Si:H interface10,11. However, both of them have a rough interface, which could introduce the deep-level defect states with additional charge carrier recombination and nonradiative open circuit voltage losses (ΔVOC)11; meanwhile, the twin boundary scatter- ing enlarge the effective mass along charge transport direction, and result in low charge carrier mobility12,13. In order to prevent from those interfacial damages, the low-temperature (around 500 K) a-Si deposi- tion technology was developed as the passivation process for the high- performance SHJ solar cells14,15. Although, the epitaxial c-Si and nanotwins are hardly prevented at the c-Si/a-Si:H interface10,11, we noticed that an intrinsic a-Si deposition ultra-thin (1 nm) buffer layer formed by radio-frequency plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposi- tion (RF-PECVD) could lower the formation of c-Si epitaxy and Received: 18 October 2022 Accepted: 8 June 2023 Check for updates 1Faculty of Materials and Manufacturing, Faculty of Information Technology, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China. 2Center for Microscopy and Analysis, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China. 3LONGi Central R&D Institute, Xian, China. 4These authors contributed equally: Feihong Chu, Xianlin Qu. e-mail: zilong.zheng@bjut.edu.cn; kunzheng@bjut.edu.cn; xuxixiang@longi.com; yzzhang@bjut.edu.cn Nature Communications| (2023) 14:3596 1 1234567890():,; 1234567890():,; nanotwins in previous report11. Unfortunately, it may bring time- consuming and additional industrial preparation process. On the other hand, our previous studies indicated the epitaxial growth can be sup- pressed by a hybrid interface with atomic steps as well, which deviates from the conventional c-Si (111) plane11. Therefore, it is urgent to understand the nature of the hybrid interface, which could provide a potential approach to further improve c-Si/a-Si:H interfacial mor- phology and the performance of SHJ solar cells. At the c-Si/a-Si:H interface, both density and arrangement of Si atoms are dependent on the c-Si lattice orientation, which lead to anisotropic epitaxial growth property. Low-index crystal planes with high-symmetry structure are energy stabilized interface, for instance, (100), (011), and (111) planes. New epitaxial Si atoms at (111) plane are not energy stable, because of three dangling bonds exposure, rather than two dangling bonds at (100) and (011) planes. Similarly, (100) and (011) planes with two dangling bonds show higher etch rate than that of (111) plane with one dangling bond. Therefore, the conventionalc-Si/ a-Si:H interface is always based on pure c-Si (111) plane, given the relatively low epitaxial growth rate and high etch rate. In this work, in combination of ex- and in-situ high resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) images of high-efﬁciency (PCE = 24.85%) SHJ industrial devices, a new modeling of c-Si/a-Si:H interfacial morphol- ogy was obtained. We then performed microsecond-long (μs) low- temperature (500 K) molecular dynamic (MD) simulations, and pro- posed a strategy for a-Si passivated contacts technique, that a hybrid interface with the mixture of those low-index planes could reduce both interfacial c-Si epitaxy and nanotwins. The pyramid texture of SHJ solar cells presents great anti- reﬂective performance. The standard apex-angle of pyramid is 70.53, which is between the (111) surface and the (1 11) surface, con- ventionally. Yan et al. investigated the impact of the apex-angle on the reﬂectance; as the apex-angle decreasing from 130 down to 50, the reﬂectance could reduce from 36.7 to 5.5%16. Actually, the small apex- angle works in favor of multiple light absorption, and result in low reﬂection. By tuning apex-angle of pyramid, the hybrid interfacial surface can consist of (111)/(100) c-Si plane, as well as, (111)/(011) c-Si plane, respectively. While the formers apex-angle is larger than 70.53, and the latter one is smaller than 70.53. In this work, we investigated interfacial c-Si epitaxy and nanotwin growth at traditional pure (111) plane, hybrid (111)/(100) plane, and hybrid (111)/(011) plane based on all-atom MD simulations. The calculated nanotwins distribution has a good agreement with measured atomic-resolution in-situ HRTEM characterization. The hybrid interface with a fraction (x), for instance, (111)1-x/(011)x, signiﬁcantly improves the c-Si/a-Si interfacial morphol- ogy with low c-Si epitaxy and nanotwins. Therefore, we design a hybrid interface by tuning pyramid apex-angle, which could prevent from both epitaxial growth and nanotwin formation in SHJ solar cells. More importantly, without additional industrial preparation process, the hybrid interface could improve c-Si/a-Si:H interfacial morphology for a-Si passivated contacts technique, and wide-applied for the silicon- based (single-junction and tandem) solar cells in the future. Results Interfacial morphology on hybrid (111)/(100) c-Si plane In order to further understand the phenomenon that the atomic steps on c-Si/a-Si:H interface can reduce nanotwins following our previous work11, the c-Si/a-Si:H interfaces were fabricated using the same industry-compatible process as that with high-efﬁciency (PCE = 24.85%) SHJ solar cells, and many large apex-angles (70.53) of pyr- amid were obtained, see Fig. 1b, c. The schematic diagram of the cross- sectional structures of the SHJ solar cells is in Fig. 1a. In order to investigate the interface conﬁguration, we fabricated TEM samples by employing the focused ion beam (FIB) technique. The cross-section of pyramid structure was marked with the red rectangular area in Fig. 1b. Figure 1c is the low magniﬁed TEM image of the pyramid, where the apex angle θ is 74.0. The conventional θ is known as 70.53, which is between the standard (111) and standard (1 11) planes of c-Si. When the apex angle θ is larger than 70.53, the increased angle results in c-Si surface deviating from (111) plane and presenting a series of atomic steps. Actually, the nature of the atomic steps is hybrid c-Si plane conﬁguration at the c-Si/a-Si:H interface, rather than pure (111) c-Si plane; the former one consists of two lattice c-Si planes, the major one is still the (111) facet, and the minor one is (100) facet. Then, we further investigated the structural characteristics of the c-Si/a-Si:H interface. Figure 1d showed morphology on ﬂat (111) plane interface, where high density nanotwins and c-Si epitaxial with a thickness of 1-2 nm were observed. Figure 1e presented the morphology on hybrid (111)/(100) plane interface, while, in comparison with pure ﬂat (111) plane, there a n-μc-SiOX ITO i-a-Si ITO p-a-Si n-c-Si i-a-Si b Ag Ag Ag Ag 10 μm c 2 μm 74.0 5 nm c-Si a-Si Nanotwin Nanotwin Nanotwin (111) [ ] [ ] [ ] Nanotwin a-Si c-Si 5 nm (111) (100) d e Fig. 1 | c-Si/a-Si:H interface structure characteristics of SHJ solar cell. a Cross- section schematic image of the SHJ solar cell, from top to bottom are Ag (silver electrode), ITO (indium tin oxide), n-μc-SiOX (n-type microcrystal SiOX), i-a-Si (intrinsic a-Si), n-c-Si (n-type crystal Si), i-a-Si (intrinsic a-Si), p-a-Si (p-type a-Si), ITO and Ag. b SEM image showed the morphology of pyramid structure on the surface of SHJ solar cells. c Low-magniﬁcation TEM image showed the cross-section of pyramid structure marked by red rectangle in Fig. 1b.

The yellow dash line represented the (111) plane, the green dash line represented the (100) plane; the white dashed line represented c-Si surface and the orange rectangle represented the nanotwins. Article https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-39342-3 Nature Communications| (2023) 14:3596 2 are low-density nanotwins nearby atomic steps. The nanotwins prefer to grow on the (111) component rather than the (100) component17. Furthermore, these similar low-density nanotwins distribution at interface were observed, see Fig. S1 in Supporting Information (SI). The c-Si epitaxy and nanotwins growth on hybrid (111)/(100) c-Si plane During the preparation of SHJ solar cells, the process could promote the formation of both c-Si epitaxy and nanotwin at the c-Si/a-Si:H interface. Therefore we investigated their distributions for both a-Si depositing process and post-deposition time evolution status, by employing molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with low- temperature (500 K) as industrial preparing process11,15. The model- ing initial conﬁgurations of c-Si/a-Si interface are based on HRTEM images of high-efﬁciency (PCE = 24.85%) SHJ industrial devices, as shown in Fig. S2 in SI11. The interface with single (111) c-Si plane started forming nanotwin structure at 0.15 μs, and the latter meets to form embedded nanotwin at 0.9 μs, as shown in Fig. S3 in SI. Considering the time scale for the formation of embedded nanotwins, we simulated the morphological evolution of the c-Si/a-Si interface at 500 K with a total time of 1 μs. According to anisotropy of c-Si epitaxy and nanotwin on different low- index surfaces (see details in Supplementary Note 1), the hybrid plane can be regarded as consisting of several low-index surface composi- tions, and the latter have a critical role in the impact on the epitaxial c-Si and nanotwin17,18. The new generated epitaxial c-Si atoms as a function of time, as shown in Fig. 2a. A linear increasing trend of c-Si epitaxial growth was obtained, and the epitaxial c-Si generation rate were estimated with a line-ﬁtting, see the slope of ﬁtting curves in Fig. 2a. The hybrid (111)0.9/(100)0.1 plane has a similar c-Si epitaxy rate (1.5  1014 cm2  μs1) as thatof the pure (111) plane (1.4  1014 cm2  μs1). It indicated a small amount of (100) component cannot have a sig- niﬁcant effect on c-Si epitaxy. However, when traditional (111) plane mixing with (100) plane, the nanotwin growth rate was dropped down signiﬁcantly, from 1.1  1014 cm2  μs1 at pure (111) plane down to 0.6  1014 cm2  μs1 at the hybrid (111)0.9/(100)0.1 plane, see Fig. 2b. Compared with interface defect density at c-Si/a-Si:H of high-efﬁciency SHJ devices (about 1010cm2)19,20, the interfacial epitaxial c-Si and nanotwin atomic density is several orders of magnitude more than interface defect density, in consideration of the nanotwin or epitaxial c-Si consisting of thousands of Si atoms only introduce a few defect states. Moreover, we further investigated the spatial distribution of nanotwins at c-Si/a-Si interface of hybrid (111)0.9/(100)0.1 plane, see Fig. 2c; while the top panel (side view) presented the initial modeling structure of the c-Si/a-Si interface along the 110 direction; the ﬂat area is (111) facet, and the atomic step area is (100) facet; the latter were marked with green rectangles. In the equilibrium conﬁgurations exported from MD simulations with a short time-scale of 0.1 μs, the nanotwins (marked with orange color) are generated and mainly localized on the (111) facet rather than (100) facet, see Fig. 2c middle panel. The nanotwins grow until the edge of (111) facet, and blocked by the (100) facet of atomic steps atc-Si/a-Si interface. The blocking effect on hybrid (111)/(100) plane was conﬁrmed by HRTEM imaging, see Fig. 2d top panel; where the nanotwins grew only on (111) facet, as shown in orange dashed rectangle, but cannot pass across the boundary between (100) and (111) facet. In order to further conﬁrm the (100) nanotwin blocking effect, we made a MD simulation with a long time-scale of 1.1 μs. The new generated nanotwins (marked with yellow color) still distribute only on (111) facets, and the (100) facets prevent from the nanotwins growth, see Fig. 2c bottom panel. Employing in situ heating microelectromechanical systems (MEMs) at 500 K for 1 h, the atomic-resolution HRTEM images of hybrid (111)/(100) plane demon- strated the same conclusion as theoretical results, that new growing nanotwins (marked by the yellow dashed rectangle) were blocked by the (100) facet of atomic steps at c-Si/a-Si:H interface, see Fig. 2d bottom panel. The c-Si epitaxy and nanotwin growth on hybrid (111)/(011) c-Si plane The above hybrid (111)/(100) c-Si plane signiﬁcantly inhibits the nanotwins growth, unfortunately, the c-Si epitaxy cannot be sup- pressed. Compared with the property of pure (100) plane, the pure (011) plane could prevent from both nanotwin growth and c-Si epitaxy.

We therefore investigated the property of (111)/(011) c-Si plane, in order to look for better suppression capability to nanotwin growth and c-Si epitaxy, compared to traditional (111) plane or hybrid (111)/(100) c-Si plane. The modeling hybrid (111)0.9/(011)0.1 plane was shown in Fig. S2, and we performed microsecond-long MD simulation for c-Si/a-Si interfacial morphology with low-temperature (500 K), which is the same as industrial a-Si deposition technology. The c-Si epitaxial growth rate (0.5  1014 cm2  μs1) of hybrid (111)0.9/(011)0.1 plane is signiﬁcantly lower than both of traditional (111) plane (1.4  1014 cm2  μs1) or hybrid (111)0.9/(100)0.1 plane (1.5  1014 cm2  μs1); while, the former with (011) facet atomic steps can suppress c-Si epitaxy effectively, as shown in Fig. 3a. However, when we continue to increase the (011) facet com- ponent (x) to 0.2, the hybrid (111)0.8/(011)0.2 c-Si plane increase the c-Si epitaxial rate slightly (1.9  1014 cm2μs1) compared with 1.4  1014 cm2  μs1 of pure (111) plane. More component of (011) facet cannot be helpful, considering high the c-Si epitaxial rate of pure (011) plane22. The c-Si/a-Si interfacial energies were exported from MD simulations, and the lowest one is on hybrid (111)0.9/(011)0.1 c-Si plane, compared with the three others on traditional (111), hybrid (111)0.8/ (011)0.2 and above hybrid (111)0.9/(100)0.1 c-Si planes, see Fig. S4 in SI; while it implied the former is energetic stable. Moreover, when a-Si atoms converting to c-Si atoms, the averaged stabilization energies on each atom in the system, were obtained with the order of 8 meV on hybrid (111)0.9/(011)0.1, 11 meV on hybrid (111)0.9/(100)0.1, 12 meV on traditional (111), and 14 meV on hybrid (111)0.8/(011)0.2; while hybrid (111)0.9/(011)0.1 plane provided the minimal driving force for both epitaxial c-Si and twin silicon (twin-Si) growth. We next looked for the twin-Si growth on a-Si/(111)0.9/(011)0.1 c-Si interface. Since there are not any twin-Si atoms on initial modeling conﬁgurations, they started growing on both traditional (111) and hybrid (111)/(011) planes, following the ﬁrst 0.4 μs MD simulations. While, those twin-Si atoms are mainly localized on (111) area, which is the major component on both pure (111) and hybrid (111)/(011) planes, and twin-Si growth has the same rate around 1.1  1014 cm2  μs1 at the beginning. However, when the twin-Si atoms extend to the (011) component on hybrid (111)/(011) plane, they start reducing with the rate of 0.5  1014 cm2  μs1 and 1.1  1014 cm2  μs1 on hybrid (111)0.9/ (011)0.1 plane and (111)0.8/(011)0.2 plane, respectively. The negative twin-Si growth rates are due to the low potential barrier (0.10 eV) of transformation from twin-Si to c-Si on (011) area, compared with 0.34 eV barrier on (111) area, which are calculated via density functional theory (DFT) method, see Fig. S5 in SI. The twin-Si atoms disappear mainly around the (011) plane, and considering more component on (111)0.8/(011)0.2 plane, the disappearance of twin-Si was obvious rather than on hybrid (111)0.9/(011)0.1 plane, and see Fig. S6 in SI. As the above (100) twin-Si blocking effect on hybrid (111)/(100) plane, the (011) component presents the same blocking function on (111)/(011) plane. When the latter stay the same, for instance (011) component keep 0.1 on (111)0.9/(011)0.1 plane, the breadth of each (011) atomic steps impact the twin-Si blocking effect. When the (011) breadth become large, each the related (111) continuous region are expanded as well, see Fig. S7 in SI. Based on 1.5 μs MD simulations with modeling structures of multiple two-atom breadth of (011) steps, the twin-Si distributions were signiﬁcantly increased, compared with the result of two-atom breadth on the hybrid (111)0.9/(011)0.1 plane, as shown in Fig. S8 in SI. Therefore, the short breadth of (011) atomic steps may prevent from twin-Si growth region expansion effectively, MD simulation in a-Si deposition 0.00 0.25 0.50 0.75 1.00 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 (111)1.0 (111)0.9 /(011)0.1 (111)0.8 /(011)0.2 i S -c laix a ti p E S / N (1014 cm-2) Time ( s) c-Si 0.00 0.25 0.50 0.75 1.00 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 i S - n i w t S / N (1014 cm-2) Time ( s) twin-Si 0 10 20 30 40 50 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 (111)1.0 (111)0.9 /(100)0.1 (111)0.9 /(011)0.1 (111)0.8 /(011)0.2 i S -c laix a ti p E N/S (1015 cm-2) Time (ns) c-Si 0 10 20 30 40 50 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 i S - n i w t S / N (1015 cm-2) Time (ns) twin-Si 1.4 (1014 cm-2 s-1) 1.9 (1014 cm-2 s-1) 0.5 (1014 cm-2 s-1) 1.1 (1014 cm-2 s-1) -0.5 (1014 cm-2 s-1) -1.1 (1014cm-2 s-1) 1.6 1015 cm-2 1.7 1015 cm-2 2.1 1015 cm-2 0.6 1015 cm-2 0.6 1015 cm-2 0.9 1015 cm-2 0.7 1015 cm-2 d b a c Fig. 3 | Molecular dynamic simulations of epitaxial c-Si and twin-Si growth. a, b The densities of new generated epitaxial c-Si (a) and twin-Si (b) on pure (111) c-Si plane, hybrid (111)0.9/(011)0.1 plane, and hybrid (111)0.8/(011)0.2 plane, as a function of time at 500 K.

The formations of both epitaxial c-Si and twin-Si in a-Si deposition In addition to the dynamic evolution process at c-Si/a-Si interface in SHJ solar cells, we investigated c-Si epitaxial growth and twin-Si for- mation in the a-Si deposition passivated process as well. The c-Si/a-Si interfacial morphologies of traditional (111) plane, hybrid (111)/(100) plane, and hybrid (111)/(011) plane were obtained via MD simulations under the a-Si deposition condition, see Fig. 4e, d and f, respectively. While the new generated nanotwins (marked with orange color) on the former are much more than those on hybrid planes. Figure 3c, d pre- sented the atomic number of new epitaxial c-Si and nanotwins as a function of time. All of them have levelled off following a period of rapid linear rise. The reason is that, for instance, the thickness of deposited a-Si atoms is around 2 nm after 30 ns MD simulations, which prevented the new depositing a-Si atoms from touching the c-Si layer (or arriving at the c-Si/a-Si interface). Therefore, the amounts of both generated epitaxial c-Si and nanotwins reached stable statuses, and we exported those numbers from the MD simulations, which were marked in Fig. 3c, d as well. The fewest two epitaxial c-Si reached 1.61015 cm2 on hybrid (111)0.9/(011)0.1 plane and 1.7  1015 cm2 on traditional (111) plane. While, the fewest two twin-Si formation reached both 0.6  1015 cm2 on hybrid (111)0.9/(100)0.1 plane or hybrid (111)0.9/(011)0.1 plane. Considering the lower formation energy of c-Si rather than that of twin-Si, see above Fig. S5 in SI, the epitaxial c-Si growth is more than twin-Si formation. In consistent with the above result of c-Si/a-Si interface in SHJ solar cells, the hybrid (111)0.9/(011)0.1 plane should be considered as a key candidate to reduce both epitaxial c-Si and nanotwin-Si based on the a-Si deposition MD simulations. We then obtained the dynamic snapshots for both hybrid (111)0.9/ (100)0.1 plane or hybrid (111)0.9/(011)0.1 plane, see Fig. 4g and h, respectively. Both (100) component and (011) component prevented from twin-Si expansion along the c-Si/a-Si interface, as well as, have the role of twin-Si blocking function on hybrid (111)/(100) and hybrid (111)/ (011) c-Si planes. We derived both epitaxial c-Si and twin-Si atom areal density on each (111), (100), and (011) components of hybrid planes, in order to distinguish from the impact on three of them, quantiﬁca- tionally, see Fig. 4i, j, k and l. The (111) component had the fewest epitaxial c-Si growth and the most twin-Si formation. The (011) com- ponent had the lower epitaxial c-Si growth and twin-Si formation than that of (100) component on hybrid c-Si plane. Therefore, compared with the traditional standard (111) and the above observed hybrid (111)/ (100) c-Si plane in experiment, the hybrid (111)/(011) c-Si plane could have more possibility to improve the c-Si/a-Si interfacial morphology; while the latter could be realized on the side surface of textured pyr- amid with apex angle θ slightly smaller than 70.53, see Fig. 4c. Discussion Based on the model from c-Si/a-Si:H interfacial morphology in high- efﬁciency SHJ industrial devices via ex- and in situ high resolution TEM images, we performed microsecond-long low-temperature (500 K) molecular dynamic simulations, and proposed a strategy to prevent from both epitaxial c-Si growth and nanotwin formation, that the texture could have a decreased pyramid apex-angle (slightly smaller than 70.53). The new apex-angle consists of hybrid (111)0.9/(011)0.1 plane, rather than pure (111) plane in conventional textured pyramid. The nature of the hybrid c-Si plane is low-energy c-Si/a-Si interface, which is unfavorable for either epitaxial c-Si growth or nanotwins formation. More importantly, without additional industrial prepara- tion process, the hybrid plane could improve c-Si/a-Si:H interfacial 0 25 50 0 1 2 3 (111)0.9 (011)0.1 i S -c laix a ti p x E N/S (1015 cm-2) Time (ns) 0 25 50 0 1 2 3 i S - n i w t N/S (1015 cm-2) Time (ns) 0 25 50 0 1 2 3 (111)0.9 (100)0.1 i S -c laix a ti p x E N/S (1015 cm-2) Time (ns) 0 25 50 0 1 2 3 i S - n i w t N/S (1015 cm-2) Time (ns) (111)0.9/(011)0.1 (111)1.0 h c-Si atom twin-Si atom a-Si atom i j g k l (111)0.9/(100)0.1 2.8 2.0 0.2 0.6 2.4 1.5 0.1 0.7 Nanotwin Epitaxial c-Si Epitaxial c-Si Nanotwin 10 ns 50 ns 0 ns 10 ns 50 ns 0 ns  70.5 = 70.5  70.5 d e f a b c Fig. 4 | Interfacial morphology of molecular dynamic simulations in a-Si deposition process. ac Schematic diagram of textured pyramid with apex angle θ  70.53 (a), θ = 70.53 (b) and θ  70.53(c). df the top view of the c-Si/a-Si interface for the hybrid (111)0.9/(100)0.1 plane (d), pure (111) plane (e), and hybrid (111)0.9/(011)0.1 plane (f), following a-Si deposition simulations, while in order to present the distribution of epitaxial c-Si and nanotwins, all a-Si atoms are hidden; the green and red rectangle represents the minor plane in hybrid c-Si interface, (100) facet and (011) facet, respectively; the white dashed line represents the side view position. g, h The side view of c-Si/a-Si interface of hybrid (111)0.9/(100)0.1 plane (g) and hybrid (111)0.9(011)0.1 plane (h) along with time t = 0 ns (top panel), t = 10 ns (middle panel), as well as t = 50 ns (bottom panel).

Methods Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations The classical MD simulations were performed by using a large-scale atomic/molecular massively parallel simulator (LAMMPS)23. H atoms have crucial roles in the saturation of dangling bonds in the a-Si:H layer and at the c-Si/a-Si:H interface15,24. Furthermore, the a-Si:H layer including the presence of appropriate amounts of H atoms is investigated2530. However, the Si-H potential function shows a over- estimating melting point than that of experiment31. In order to describe the effect of the H atom on the pure (111) and hybrid (111)/ (011) plane, we performed all atom MD simulations for c-Si/a-Si:H interfacial morphology with 10% hydrogen content at high- temperature (1000 K) for 300 ns, considering the time-consuming MD simulations (see details in Supplementary Note 2). At c-Si/a-Si:H interface, the hybrid (111)/(011) plane prevents from both epitaxial c-Si growth and nanotwin formation, which was the consistent with c-Si/a- Si interface. Therefore, considering the melting point consistent with the experiment and the calculation time consuming, all MD simula- tions are used with the Tersoff-mod potential to derive Si atomic interactions32. In order to avoid the edge effect, the periodic boundary conditions (PBC) and a time step of 2 femtoseconds (fs) were applied in the simulations. All equilibrium structures were obtained in the isothermal-isobaric (NPT) ensemble with a pressure of 1 bar at the room temperature (T = 300 K). The pressure was controlled by means Parrinello-Rahman Barosta. Considering sample preparation process (T = 500 K) of high-efﬁciency (PCE = 24.85%) SHJ industrial devices11, Nosé-Hoover thermostat and Langevin method was applied for time- dependent morphological evolutions of c-Si/a-Si interface and a-Si deposition processes, with the same temperature as 500 K, respec- tively. The length scale of modeling systems was around 13 nm  5 nm  10 nm. The c-Si/a-Si interface model is composed of c-Si and a-Si with total amount of 35,000 atoms. The c-Si, twin-Si and a-Si atoms were determined by the second nearest neighbors arrangement of each central silicon atom and using Open Visualization Tool (OVITO)33,34. When the second nearest neighbors are arranged on a face center cubic (FCC) lattice (or hexagonal close packed (HCP) lat- tice), the central silicon atom was marked as c-Si (or twin-Si) atom, otherwise it was marked as a-Si atom. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations All DFT calculations were obtained by employing the Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package (VASP)3537 and projector augmented wave (PAW)38 methods. The exchange correlation can be described in the form of GGA-PBE39. The long-range van der Waals interactions proposed by Grimme et al. (DFT-D3)40 and the kinetic energy cutoff of electron wave functions was 500 eV. The structure of the transition state was obtained via the nudged-elastic-band (NEB) method, which calculated the minimum energy curves along a prescribed dissociation pathway41,42. The initial and ﬁnal states were based on the optimized structures with the total energy of the system converged to less than 105eV, as well as, the force on each atom converged to less than 0.01 eVÅ1.
