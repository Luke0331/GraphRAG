Email: shanthinelson@gmail.com Funding information Cochin University of Science and Technology Summary Antireflection coating (ARC) plays a crucial role in many solar and optical applications. ARC with mechanical robustness was developed to achieve more efficiency for the photovoltaic system cover glasses, by depositing porous Vinyltriethoxysilane/Pluronic F-127-based coating via spin coating technique. The coating shows maximum transparency around 93% in the visible region (400-800 nm). The mechanical robustness of the coating was analyzed using a pencil scratch test as per the ASTM standard D 3363-05 and it showed good stability against a 9H hardness pencil. The porous coating exhibited an enhanced conversion efficiency of 10.56% as compared to the bare glass of effi- ciency 9.71%; which validate the light-trapping ability of the coating in the visi- ble region. Also, the coating sustains the efficiency of the solar cell even during dust exposure due to its good self-cleaning ability with water contact angle of 112. It is also noteworthy that the prepared ARC shows UV stability under the UV-B lamp for 72 hours. The ARC developed in this study opens a promising approach to harvest renewable solar energy for photovoltaic systems.

There has been an increase in energy demand in recent years as a result of population growth and industrial development.1,2 Renewable energy resources have the potential to address the energy crisis to an extent because of their large availability and capac- ity to refill themselves in less than a human life without diminishing the planets resources.3,4 Solar energy tech- nology can be considered as an inventive technology, which provides predominant energy for many purposes. Among them, photovoltaic devices are appraised as the most suitable solar energy harvester. Photovoltaic devices such as solar cells require cost-effective nonreflective optical elements to concentrate the solar energy in a small area.5,6 The solar cell needs protection from harsh environmental conditions for better performance and is generally provided by the cover glasses. The cover glass has several desirable features, including optical transpar- ency and visual appearance.7 The performance of a solar cell integrated with a cover glass depends on the amount of radiation within a particular range of the solar spec- trum that passes through the cover glass and reaches the photovoltaic semiconductor.8,9 A part of the incoming radiation incident on the surface of the cover glass is Received: 12 January 2022 Revised: 6 May 2022 Accepted: 2 June 2022 DOI: 10.1002/er.8247 Int J Energy Res. 2022;46:1548515498. wileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/er  2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd. 15485 reflected before reaching the active solar layers. Reflec- tion is usually a detrimental phenomenon that takes place at the interface between the substrate and transmit- ted media because of the quick change in refractive index from air to the substrate and causes a loss in the effi- ciency of the solar cell. It is worthwhile to reduce the amount of radiation reflected from the incident glass substrate for reaching maximum solar radiation to the active layer of the solar cell for the enhancement of efficiency.10,11 An attempt to inscribe the preceding problem is made by using an antireflection coating on the glass substrate. An appropriate antireflection coating transmits more solar radiation through the glass, thereby photovoltaic devices receive additional light, hence, an improvement in the output power. An ideal antireflection coating must fulfill the following conditions for zero reflection. First, the thickness of the coating must be one-quarter of the incident wavelength and second the refractive index of the coating should be equal to (nons)1/2, where no and ns are the refractive index of the air and substrate, respec- tively.12,13 It is difficult to attain the refractive index of the coating about 1.22 since the low index materials (MgF2, SiO2) have a refractive index above 1.38. This problem can be solved by inducing pores into the antire- flection coatings.14,15 Antireflection property can be obtained based on the topography of the material. The surface of the substrate combined with air on a subwavelength scale such as a porous or textured surface would have AR properties. In recent years, great efforts have been made by researchers in this area, especially in nano-porous film. Several stud- ies have been reported with porous silica material to enhance light transmission, in which most of the researchers used Tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) as the major precursor of SiO2. Qianying Zhang et al, fabricated a single-layer SiO2 coating using TEOS as the major pre- cursor and deposited it on the glass substrate using the dip-coating method. Furthermore, it was modified with dimethyl silicone to enhance its hydrophobic and adhe- sive properties.16 Similarly, Yixuan Su and his team developed TEOS-based multifunctional coating with an additional property of UV resistance.17 Attila Abraham et al prepared TEOS/MTES-based durable microporous transparent coating with CTAB surfactant.18 High trans- mittance of 99.8% was obtained at 632 nm wavelength with a refractive index of 1.25. Xuan Wang et al made an effort to prepare a durable superhydrophilic AR film and also checked the reliability of the prepared film for PV solar glass application.19 However, most of the researchers only reported the preparation and different characteristics of AR film and did not attempt to demon- strate its applicability in PV solar cells. Herein we report, the potential application of Vinyl- triethoxysilane/Pluronic F-127 (VTES/PF-127)-based antireflection coating to improve the power conversion efficiency of the commercially available polycrystalline Si solar cell. In the present work, VTES is used as the silica precursor and PF-127 as the pore-forming agent. Vinyl- triethoxy silane is a vinyl functional silane having an unsaturated double bond with a reactive OC2H5 group. It functions as an adhesion booster and provides a supe- rior mechanical and thermally insulating layer.20,21 Sol- gel-derived silica film exhibited adjustable refractive index, low dielectric constant, high porosity, etc.22,23 However, a sol-gel silica film with surfactant texturiza- tion improves pore volume, pore distribution, adhesion, and mechanical stability.24,25 Here, we preferred Pluronic triblock polymer PF-127 as a surfactant template among various surfactants like CTAB, PEG, etc. since it offers good transmittance as well as mechanical stability with VTES than other surfactants. Along with optical transparency, an antireflection coating must guarantee mechanical stability and the self- cleaning ability for long-term performance. Here, this work demonstrates the preparation of mechanically sta- ble hydrophobic VTES/PF-127-based antireflection coat- ing using the acid-catalyzed sol-gel method. In addition, electrical characteristics of solar cells with coated and uncoated glass substrates were carried out to examine their performance. 2 | EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS 2.1 | Preparation of VTES/PF-127-based sol for AR coating All the chemicals were used as received without any modification. Multifunctional VTES/PF-127 coating with high transparency, water repellency, mechanical stability, and UV stability was synthesized using the sol-gel method. A microscopic glass slide (25 mm  25 mm) of 1 mm thickness was chosen for the deposition of the anti- reflection coating. In the first step, an appropriate amount of ethanol (Hayman), hydrochloric acid (Merck), and deionized water were mixed in a beaker and stirred for a while. After that, an optimized amount of polymeric porogen Pluronic F-127 (PF-127, Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the solvent and stirred continuously for 30 minutes at room temperature to get homogeneous polymeric sol. The silica precursor Vinyltriethoxysilane (VTES, Sigma-Aldrich) of 2.37  103 M was dropped wisely poured into the polymeric sol and further the mag- netic stirring was continued for 2 hours to obtain the transparent VTES/PF-127 sol. Finally, the sol was left for 15486 SWATHI ET AL. 1099114x, 2022, 11, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/er.8247 by Xian Jiaotong University, Wiley Online Library on [19/06/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License aging for about 2 hours at room temperature. During aging, the sol undergoes hydrolysis and polycondensation at a very slow rate. After that, the sol was used for the deposition of the mechanically stable broadband anti- reflection coating by spin coating technique. The sche- matic diagram describing the synthesis of VTES/PF-127 sol is shown in Figure 1. 2.2 | Fabrication of multilayer AR coating The multilayer VTES/PF-127-based coatings were depos- ited on the microscopic glass slides. Prior to deposition the glass slide was washed with extran and rinsed with normal water. After that, cleaned with HCl followed by deionized water, and dried at 60C for an hour to make them free from impurities. The prepared transparent VTES/PF-127 sol was spin coated on the cleaned glass substrate at 2000 rpm speed for 60 seconds. This was repeated for the deposition of multilayer of VTES/PF-127-based coating. After the depo- sition of each coating, the substrate was heat treated at 100C for 60 seconds in a hotplate to improve the adhe- sion of the coating with the substrate. The number of layers of the coating was reduced to three layers. The glass substrate with a single, double, and triple layer of VTES/PF-127 coating was annealed at an optimized tem- perature of 250C with a ramping rate of 15C/min for an hour to obtain a multifunctional transparent film. 2.3 | Sample characterization The optical transparency of the coated substrate was mea- sured at room temperature using a UV-visible spectropho- tometer (JASCO V-670). The refractive index and thickness of the coating were determined using Ellipsometer (J.A.Woolam Co.) in the wavelength range of 300 to 900 nm. The data obtained from the ellipsometer was examined using the software Complete EASE, in order to assess the optical and physical parameters of the pre- pared AR coating with the aid of the Cauchy model. The surface morphology of the coating was analyzed using field emission scanning electron microscope, FESEM (MIRA 3 TESCAN). The porous nature of the sample was determined using Brunauer-Emmet-Teller (BET, Nova Station A). Fourier transform infrared spectro- scopic study was carried out using a SHIMADZU spec- trophotometer to determine the chemical composition of the sample. The thermal stability of the coating was analyzed using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA- EXSTAR/6300). The wettable behavior of the coating was evaluated at ambient temperature using the OCA15EC contact angle interface system. In order to evaluate the hardness of the coating, the prepared AR-coated substrates were subjected to the pen- cil scratch test, according to the ASTM standard D 3363-05 using different hardness graded pencils (9B- 9H).26 The impact of the pencil scratch on the coating was analyzed using 3D laser profilometry (ZETA-20). The stability of the AR coating against UV light was tested by exposing the samples under UV-B irradiation for various time intervals and followed by the transpar- ency analysis. The photovoltaic performance of the AR coating as a cover glass of a photovoltaic module was evaluated by using commercially available polycrystalline silicon solar cell under simulated 1000 W/m2 illumination (AM 1.5G) in air. 3 | RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The VTES/PF-127-based coating was fabricated on glass substrate using spin coating technique. The FIGURE 1 Schematic representation of preparation VTES/PF- 127 sol and coating development SWATHI ET AL. 15487 1099114x, 2022, 11, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/er.8247 by Xian Jiaotong University, Wiley Online Library on [19/06/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License concentration of the PF-127 in the sol, annealing tem- perature of the coating and number of layers deposited were optimized here. The major features of the opti- mized AR coating were analyzed by various characteri- zation techniques and are discussed in the below sections (3.1-3.8). 3.1 | Optical properties 3.1.1 | Effect of PF-127 on AR property of coating The optical performance of the broadband antireflec- tion coating was analyzed by UV-visible transmittance spectra within the visible region of 400 to 800 nm. The concentration of pluronic F-127 in the sol was optimized for the best transmittance value and was deposited on a cleaned glass substrate by spin coating with 2000 rpm speed for 1 minute and followed by annealing at 120C for an hour to remove the solvent from the film. The transmittance of the uncoated glass substrate was compared with pristine VTES and VTES/PF-127-coated glass substrate and is shown in Figure 2. From figure, it is observed that the VTES/ PF-127 sol-coated glass showed an improved transmit- tance of 1.3% in the visible region as compared to bare glass and VTES film. The maximum transmittance for the bare glass, pristine VTES, and optimized hybrid sol-coated glass were observed as 90.5%, 86.3%, and 91.7% centered at 519, 568, and 517 nm, respectively. An enhancement in the transmittance of the VTES/ PF-127 coating confirms the influence of the poly- meric surfactant in the silica network of the hybrid film.27 3.1.2 | Effect of annealing temperature To understand the influence of annealing temperature on the optical performance of the optimized sol deposited glass substrate, it was heat-treated at various tempera- tures (100C-300C) for an hour, and the recorded trans- mittance spectra within the visible wavelength range (400-800 nm) is shown in the below Figure 3. From the figure, it is clear that the transmittance of the coating increases with increasing annealing temperature. The improvement in the optical transmittance during heat treatment implies a reduction in refractive index and film thickness. The variation of refractive index during differ- ent annealing temperatures is shown in Figure 4 and the obtained data are listed in Table 1. FIGURE 2 Transmittance spectra of VTES/PF-127 film for various concentrations of PF-127 FIGURE 3 Transmittance of the optimized VTES/PF-127 sol- coated glass substrate for different nnealing temperatures FIGURE 4 Refractive index profile of the VTES/PF-127-based coating annealed at different temperatures 15488 SWATHI ET AL. 1099114x, 2022, 11, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/er.8247 by Xian Jiaotong University, Wiley Online Library on [19/06/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License The coating heat-treated at 100C showed a maxi- mum transmittance of 91.4%, with a refractive index 1.47 and thickness 903 nm, which got increased to 92.8%, with the refractive index of 1.41 and thickness 495 nm on annealing at 250C. The reduction in the refractive index of the coating indicates an increased porosity due to the decomposition of the surfactant. The refractive index and porosity of a coating can be con- nected by the following relation, np ¼ n2 1   1P ð Þþ1  1=2 where np and n are the refractive indices of the porous and dense film respectively and P is the pore vol- ume percentage.28,29 Using this relation, the porosity of the coating annealed at 250C is about 23% which showed maximum transparency of 92.8% in the visible region. However, the transmittance of the coating increases with annealing temperature only up to 250C, and further increase of annealing temperature (300C) decreases the transmittance to 92% with increased refrac- tive index of 1.44. The decrease in the transmittance due to enhanced pore size is discussed in detail in Section 3.2. For every sample, the extinction coefficient was observed as zero throughout the wavelength region (300-900 nm) which indicates its dielectric behavior.3 3.1.3 | Effect of bilayers on the AR property of coating VTES/PF-127-based multilayer system follows the same procedure as single-layer system. Figure 5 and Table 2 represent the transmission spectra and refractive index data of the multilayered coating. All the multilayered coatings showed an enhancement in the optical trans- parency as compared to that of bare glass in the visible region. Anyway, by comparing the transparency among the multilayers the single-layer hybrid coating exhibited better transparency than multilayered coating with a low refractive index, and is shown in Figure 6. The reduction in the transparency with the increasing number of layers is due to the increase in thickness of the coating. 3.2 | Morphological analysis The morphological evolution of the VTES/PF-127-based sample heat-treated at different temperatures was recorded using FESEM and the images are shown in Figure 7. In the case of the sample annealed at 100C (Figure 7A), a smooth, crack-free, uniform surface has been observed. When the sample undergoes heat treat- ment at about 250C and 300 (Figure 7B,C), the porous structure could be observed in the morphology of the coating.30 The formations of pores during heat treatment ascribed the decomposition of the polymeric surfactant PF-127. As the sample is annealed from 100C to 250C a considerable reduction in refractive index is noticed with large number of pores, while an increment in refractive index is observed as the sample heat-treated above 250C.

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License This increment in refractive index is to the enhancement of pore size, and is discussed in Section 3.3. The changes in the elemental composition during annealing were recorded using EDAX measurement. The result obtained for the samples annealed at 100C, 250C, and 300C are compared in Table 3 and its images are shown in Figure 8. The sample annealed at 100C shows the presence of Si, O, and C as the major constituent of VTES/PF-127. But in the case of the sample annealed at 250C and 300C, the occurrence of O and Si at the sur- face of the specimen in extensive quantities was found but a decrement in the percentage of C atom. The reduced weight percentage of C atom indicates the decomposition of Pluronic F-127 and the major phase of SiO2, since PF-127 begins to decompose in the tempera- ture range 220 to 500C.31 But around 58% of reduction in C weight percentage is observed as the sample annealed from 100C to 250C. This large reduction observed in the weight % of C atom may be due to the thickness variation of the sample during annealing. Walter Giurlani et al reported that the low atomic weight elements show high reduction in weight percentage as the thickness reduces.32The presence of Na, Mg, Al, and Ca in the sample is due to the glass substrate composition.33 3.3 | BET analysis To analyze the porous structure of the VTES/PF-127 coat- ing, nitrogen adsorption-desorption analysis is required, which includes pore size, pore volume, and surface area test. The N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms and pore size distribution of the sample prepared at various tem- peratures are shown in Figure 9. As per the IUPAC clas- sification, the N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms of the FIGURE 7 FESEM images of VTES/PF-127 sample heat treated at (A) 100C (B) 250C, and (C) 300C FIGURE 6 Refractive index of different multilayers of VTES/ PF-127-based coating deposited on the glass substrate 15490 SWATHI ET AL. 1099114x, 2022, 11, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/er.8247 by Xian Jiaotong University, Wiley Online Library on [19/06/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License sample annealed at 100C, 250C, and 300C exhibits Type IV isotherm, indicating the presence of mesopores (3-50 nm).34 The enhancement of the surface area, pore size, and pore volume are evidenced from BET analysis data given in Table 4. The pore size of the sample annealed at 100C, 250C, and 300C are observed to be 2.86, 4.23, and 5.61 nm with specific surface area 91.18, 115.77, and 118.6 m2/g, respectively. The data from Table 4 confirm the enlargement of pore size with the surface area during annealing. Trang Pham et al reported that an increase in pore size increases light scattering.35 Figure 10 shows the graphical representation of refractive index and trans- mittance percentage with pore size and these results indicated that the sample annealed at 300C possesses lower transmittance as compared to the sample annealed at 250C, validate there by the reduction of refractive index due to scattering by the increased pore size. 3.4 | Thermal analysis The porous structure of the VTES/PF-127-based film is related to the decomposition of the polymeric surfactant PF-127 during heat treatment. The temperature depen- dence of the prepared AR coating was already discussed in Section 3.1.2. The obtained results were further validated using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). An unannealed sample of weight 11.241 mg prepared by aging the sol at room temperature was used for the thermogravimetric measurement and its profile is shown in Figure 11. A small weight loss of 0.16 mg observed in the tem- perature range of 30C to 150C may be attributed to the loss of adsorbed water. Wu et al reported that the weight loss below 150C was due to the water evaporation.30 A weight loss of nearly 6% spotted in the temperature range 160C to 250C attributed to the decomposition of surfac- tant PF-127. A noticeable weight loss of 5.33 mg from 300C to 500C accompanied by an exothermic peak at 369C ascribes the decomposition and combustion of both the surfactant PF-127 and silica. The decomposition of pluronic F-127 is observed gradually in the tempera- ture range of 220C to 580C, as reported by Mohammad Masoud Mirhosseini et al.31 The decomposition of the PF-127 during heat treatment is responsible for the TABLE 3 Data of EDAX analysis for VTES/PF-127 sample annealed at two different temperatures Sample Atomic weight % O Si C Na Ca Mg Al AR-100C 38.05 22.09 28.25 6.57 3.44 1.61 0.0 AR-250C 44.98 28.24 11.47 8.78 4.07 1.97 0.49 AR-300C 46.46 27.45 9.74 8.81 5.05 1.99 0.50 FIGURE 8 (A) EDAX elemental spectra of the VTES/PF-127 sample annealed at 100C.

Figure 12 shows the FTIR spectra of the prepared VTES/PF-127 coating. The silica network in the hybrid material was characterized by strong absorption peaks at 957 and 1074 cm1 attributes Si O C and Si O Si bond, respectively.36 A long sharp peak appeared at 2976 cm1 indicating CH2 stretching vibration of the VTES group responsible for the hydrophobic behavior of the coating.37 A small peak observed at 2885 cm1 indi- cates the C H aliphatic stretch of PF-127.38 The band appeared at 1150, 1246, 1389, and 1519 cm1 associated with both PPO and PEO parts of PF-127.39,40 Besides, the band at 3649 cm1 was responsible for the O-H stretching vibration of PF-127.41 FTIR analysis indicates that PF-127 has bonded successfully with VTES molecules.

Here in this method, the pencil was firmly held against the coated substrate placed on a horizontal surface at an angle of 45, and moved over the sample. Changes in the surface roughness were analyzed using a 3D laser profilometer. The single-layer AR coating showed good resistance against the highest hardness pencil (9H) with the rough- ness of 1.07 μm and the obtained surface profile before and after scratching with 9H pencil are shown in Figure 13. 3.6.2 | Environmental stability of the coating under UV-light irradiation The environmental stability of the coating against UV light was determined by exposing the VTES/PF-127 sam- ple under a UV-B light source of 50 W. The distance between the light and the sample was kept at approxi- mately 10 cm to avoid the thermal heating of the sample due to the radiation. The % transmittance change of the VTES/PF-127 coating after UV light exposure for 72 hours is shown in Figure 14. Youngseok Lee reported silica-based double stack AR coating with UV light expo- sure lifetime of 50 hours. The direct UV exposure for 50 hours is similar to the 5 months exposure in real life.42 From Figure 14, it is clear that the transparency of the coating has decreased by just 1% as compared to that of the sample before UV-light exposure. This small change in the transparency ensures the stability of the coating against UV light and can last for a long time when it is exposed to outdoor environmental conditions for 72 hours. 3.7 | Hydrophobic property of VTES/PF- 127-based coating The nonwettable surfaces are essential for the self- cleaning mechanism when used in outdoors. The self- cleaning performance of the prepared VTES/PF-127 coating was evaluated by a Water contact angle test. With a con- tact angle greater than 90, water droplets on the hydro- phobic surface will flow very quickly and preserve their spherical shape.43 Figure 15A showed the contact angle of FIGURE 10 Refractive index and transmittance percentage of VTES/PF-127 film with different pore size formed during annealing (100, 250, and 300) FIGURE 11 Thermo gravimetric analysis profile of the VTES/ PF-127-based powder obtained by the evaporation of the sol FIGURE 12 FTIR peak assignments of VTES/PF-127-based antireflection coating SWATHI ET AL. 15493 1099114x, 2022, 11, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/er.8247 by Xian Jiaotong University, Wiley Online Library on [19/06/2025].

The hydrophobic coat- ing causes water droplets to bead on the surface, allowing dirt to adhere to and roll off with the water and maintain the surface clean. Figure 15B,C represents the visual images of the water droplet on the coated and uncoated substrates and its self-cleaning ability, respectively. 3.8 | Solar cell performance evaluation In order to assess the practicality of the mechanically stable VTES/PF-127-based single-layer AR coating on cover glass for solar panel, the coated specimen was placed over the commercially available polycrystalline solar cell (Loom Solar) and its photovoltaic performance was measured. The measurements were carried out using FIGURE 13 Laser surface profile of the VTES/PF-127-based single-layer AR coating (A) Before scratching (B) After scratching with 9H pencil FIGURE 14 Transmittance spectra of the VTES/PF-127-based sample before and after UV irradiation 15494 SWATHI ET AL. 1099114x, 2022, 11, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/er.8247 by Xian Jiaotong University, Wiley Online Library on [19/06/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License a polycrystalline Si solar cell of 25  25 mm2 dimensions and illuminated with an air mass (AM) 1.5G solar spec- trum at normal incidence. The efficiency of the cell was calculated using the following equation.44 η ¼ ISC VOC FF GA where ISC and VOC are the short-circuit current and open-circuit voltage, G is the power of the lamp, FF is the fill factor and A is the area of the solar cell. The charac- teristics of solar cells with coated and uncoated glass covers are shown in Figure 16 and the parameters obtained were tabulated in Table 5. From Table 5, it is clear that the solar cell with VTES/ PF-127-based antireflection cover glass achieved signifi- cant improvement in efficiency compared to the cell with uncoated cover glass. The solar cell with uncoated cover glass shows an efficiency of 9.71% with a current density (JSC) of 27.7 mA/cm,2 open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.59 V, and fill factor (FF) of 0.587. In contrast, the per- formance of the solar cell with coated cover glass improved to 10.56% efficiency with a current density of 29.6 mA/cm2, an open-circuit voltage of 0.60 V, and a fill factor of 0.594. The current density of the cell with coated cover glass was observed to increase by 6.4% than the uncoated glass cover. This rise in the current density is reflected in the efficiency enhancement of the solar cell. Gilad Marko et al reported that increased open-circuit voltage increases the PV efficiency.45 The enhanced fill factor from 0.587 to 0.594 implies an increased interfacial area for collecting charge carriers.46 An increment of 0.85% of efficiency represents 9.09% gain in output power. The increased power of the solar cell signifies that more electron-hole carriers are created and effectively extracted to the conducting layer of the solar cell due to the anti- reflective effect of the VTES/PF-127 cover glass. The improvement in the total conversion efficiency of the solar cell validates the light-trapping ability of the pre- pared VTES/PF-127-based porous structure and can be considered as a promising antireflecting cover glass for a photovoltaic system.47 The current work further highlights that the hydro- phobic antireflection-coated cover glass not only enhances PV performance but also maintains efficiency due to its good self-cleaning ability. This was tested by subjecting dusty-coated substrate over the solar cell and performing I-V characterization. The characteristics of the VTES/PF-127 coating under different conditions were shown in Figure 16C, D. The efficiency of the coated glass was observed to be reduced by 0.5% representing a 5.1% loss of output power due to dust accumulation. According to Ramli et al, the loss in efficiency could be caused by a rise in temperature above the cell due to light absorption by the dust layers.48 As a result, dust deposi- tion on the solar module has a negative impact on its electrical properties, lowering its overall performance. After self-cleaning, the dust particles that appeared on the cover glass were washed away and an improvement in the light absorption with in active layers results 98.6% FIGURE 15 (A) Water contact angle of the VTES/PF-127 based coating (B,C) Visual images of water droplets on the coated and uncoated glass substrates SWATHI ET AL. 15495 1099114x, 2022, 11, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/er.8247 by Xian Jiaotong University, Wiley Online Library on [19/06/2025].

Therefore, the obtained results validate the sustainability of the effi- ciency of the photovoltaic module after the self-cleaning performance. 4 | CONCLUSION VTES/PF-127-based single-layer hydrophobic antireflec- tion coating was fabricated successfully. The optical prop- erty and surface morphology of the prepared coating at various annealing temperatures (100C-300) were inves- tigated. It was observed that with increasing annealing temperature from 100C to 250C the transmittance of the sample enhanced from 91.4% to 92.8% with decreasing refractive index value of 1.47 to 1.41 in the wavelength range 400 to 800 nm. The increase in trans- mittance during annealing ascribes the reduction of refractive index, and is due to the formation of mesopores as the polymeric surfactant PF-127 decomposes. The heat treatment above 250C reduces the transmittance from 92.8% to 92% with an increased refractive index from FIGURE 16 (A) Current-Voltage curves of the solar cell covered with uncoated and VTES/PF-127-based-coated glass substrate.

The porous structure of the coating was revealed by Brunauer-Emmet-Teller analysis and, the pore size was obtained as 4.21 nm for the optimized heat- treated (250C) sample. Meanwhile, the prepared meso- porous structured surface effectively enhances the effi- ciency of solar cells from 9.71% to 10.56% with an increased output power of 9.09%. Also, the coating retains its efficiency even after exposure to dust due to good self- cleaning ability. Moreover, the stability of the coating was performed against 9H pencil and UV-B (280-320 nm) light, and which showed good mechanical, UV- irradiation stability. Hence, the prepared cost-effective VTES/PF-127-based multifunctional AR coating offers a great opportunity to improve the efficiency of solar cell.
