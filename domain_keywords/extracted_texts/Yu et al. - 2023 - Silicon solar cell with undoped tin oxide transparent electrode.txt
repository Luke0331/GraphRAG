The limited supply of rare indium and the high cost of silver paste are among the most important problems that SHJ solar cells will face. To overcome the obstacle of indium-based transparent electrodes for efficient SHJ solar cells, here we successfully prepared cheap and mass-producible undoped tin oxide (SnOx) electrode materials by sputtering at room temperature. Taking advantage of its natural oxygen vacancy defect, the carrier mobility and resistivity of prepared materials reached 22 cm2 V1 s1 and 2.38  103 Ω cm, respectively. The SHJ solar cell with an undoped SnOx front transparent electrode demonstrated an efficiency of 24.91%. Furthermore, SnOx films have excellent chemical stability and can withstand corrosion by acid and alkali solutions during electroplating processes. Finally, SHJ solar cells with plating copper electrode and double-sided indium-based transparent electrodes halved were prepared, and a certified efficiency of 25.94% (total area of 274.4 cm2) was achieved. Low-cost and highly efficient solar cells are vital for achieving the goal of carbon neutralization. Silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cells have become a research hotspot in the photovoltaic field because of their high conversion efficiency and low temperature coefficient1. Pres- ently, SHJ solar cells with interdigitated back contacts have reached power conversion efficiencies 26% (ref. 2). However, the expensive indium-based transparent electrodes (TEs) and silver metal elec- trodes limit their large-scale applications in the future3. Therefore, it is imperative to largely reduce the consumption of indium-based TEs and silver to achieve the target output for sustainable multi-terawatt scale manufacturing. Materials such as aluminium-doped zinc oxide (AZO) and boron-doped zinc oxide have been selected to partially replace the need for indium-based TEs, achieving an efficiency of 23.90% (bifacial cell with indium tin oxide (ITO)/AZO/ITO front TE and AZO rear TE)4 and 16.60% (bifacial cell with ITO front TE and boron-doped zinc oxide rear TE)5, respectively. However, this remains a far cry from the performance of current SHJ solar cells based on indium-based TEs. Besides, if the electrodes are prepared using electroplating processes, the acid and alkali resistance of TEs must be considered6. ZnO-based materials developed so far are not very resistant to corrosion7. Undoped SnOx thin films fabricated by solution and atom layer deposition have been widely investigated for perovskite8,9, silicon10,11 and perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells12,13 as a selective carrier trans- port layer or an anti-ion-bombardment buffer layer, respectively. Up to now, there are almost no reports on the use of TEs in solar cells. Here, sputtering, widely used for SHJ solar cells and therefore a compatible deposition technology for commercialization, was Received: 10 January 2023 Accepted: 7 July 2023 Published online: 7 August 2023 Check for updates 1Suzhou Maxwell Technologies Co., Ltd., Suzhou, P.

Thus, the PL peak at 448 nm can be attributed to the elec- tron transition from the conduction band minimum to the V++ O energy level. The origin of the peak at 500 nm is not entirely clear, but accord- ing to other reports available, it may be related to the electron transi- tion from the conduction band minimum to the VSn energy level19. A schematic representation of the above defect levels and emission routes is given in Supplementary Fig. 2. The XPS study confirms the highly oxygen-deficient non- stoichiometric formation of the SnOx film deposited at room tem- perature. The room temperature PL emission at 399 nm and 448 nm were dominated by the oxygen vacancies. The above results explain the outstanding electrical properties of the SnOx films. Subsequently, the optimized SnOx thin films were applied to traditional SHJ solar cells as the front TE layer, replacing IMO:H to reduce the metal indium content. The structure of the SHJ solar cells is shown in Fig. 1f (inset). A total of nine SHJ solar cells of M6 size were prepared (Supplementary Fig. 3), with an average efficiency of 24.83%, while the highest efficiency was 24.91% (open-circuit voltage, Voc = 747.7 mV; short-circuit cur- rent density, Jsc = 39.60 mA cm2; FF = 84.14%) (Fig. 1f). The efficiency obtained in this work is at the leading edge compared with existing research on SHJ solar cells based on non-In2O3 TE materials5,20. This work shows that undoped SnOx films can be used as a window TE layer in SHJ solar cells, providing a reliable option to reduce the production cost of SHJ solar cells. IMO:H+SnOx bilayer film and SHJ solar cells A satisfactory efficiency was obtained when using SnOx to replace IMO:H as the front TE layer in SHJ solar cells. However, we found that there was still a tiny difference of less than 1% compared with the non- replaced cell with an efficiency of 25.84% (Supplementary Fig. 4). The difference is mainly in the FF and Jsc. The average absorptance of SnOx (0.94%) is slightly larger than that of IMO:H (0.67%) in the wavelength range of 4001200 nm (Supplementary Fig. 5a), espe- cially in the short wavelength region. In addition, the band gap of SnOx (3.860 eV) is slightly smaller than that of IMO:H (3.897 eV), as can be understood from the Tauc plot (Supplementary Fig. 5b), so the transmission of light in the short wavelength region is also limited. In addition, the contact resistivity (ρc) between TEs and n-µc-SiOx:H is also an essential parameter for the performance of SHJ solar cells. The Cox and Strack configuration was used to measure ρc. See our previ- ous work for details of the principle21. The ρc between SnOx and IMO:H with n-µc-SiOx:H, respectively, were studied. The structures of the devices are shown in Supplementary Fig. 6a. ρc is the slope of (Rt  Rs) with respect to the curve of 4(πd2)  1 according to this principle. The fitting results are shown in Supplementary Fig. 6b. The ρc between the SnOx and n-μc-SiOx:H is 156.3 mΩ cm2, which is much greater than that between IMO:H and n-μc-SiOx:H (23.3 mΩ cm2) (Supplementary Table 4). As a result, the large ρc between SnOx and n-μc-SiOx:H is also an important reason for the reduced performance of SHJ solar cells with front SnOx TEs. Therefore, to further improve the efficiency, we designed IMO:H+SnOx bilayer thin films to increase the electrical conductivity of the films. For the IMO:H+SnOx bilayer films on glass substrate, the thickness ratio of IMO:H and SnOx layers is 1:1, while maintaining a total bilayer thickness of 100 nm. The bilayer thin film has good optical properties with an absorption coefficient of 1.94  105 cm1 at 600 nm (Supplementary Fig. 7). As can be seen from the XRD results in Fig. 2a, the crystalline orientation of the bilayer films was the same as that of IMO:H, and no characteristic peaks of SnOx were found. Therefore, the bilayer film combines an amorphous SnOx film and a polycrystalline IMO:H film. However, the crystallization peak strength of the bilayer film is weaker because the IMO:H film thickness is halved. In addition, applied to fabricate undoped SnOx TEs. The undoped SnOx film has a low absorption coefficient of 2.14  105 cm1 at 600 nm. The carrier mobility and resistivity of the prepared materials reach 22 cm2 V1 s1 and 2.38  103 Ω cm, respectively. We replaced the front TEs in SHJ solar cells with undoped SnOx films, and an efficiency of 24.91% was obtained. We also reduced the contact resistance with n-µc-SiOx:H by means of hydrogenated transition metal-doped indium oxide (IMO:H)+SnOx bilayer films, which facilitates the enhancement of the fill factor (FF) and further improves the performance of the SHJ solar cells. In addition, it was verified that the IMO:H+SnOx bilayer films have good resistance to acid and alkali corrosion. Finally, a certified efficiency of 25.94% (total area of 274.4 cm2) was achieved by applying the IMO:H+SnOx bilayer films combined with the copper electroplating process for SHJ solar cells. SnOx film and SHJ solar cells The properties of the undoped SnOx films deposited under different process conditions are shown in Supplementary Fig. 1 and Supplemen- tary Table 1. We obtained good-quality undoped SnOx films by adjusting the deposition process (Supplementary Table 2). Among them, the film with the best opto-electrical properties showed a resistivity of 2.38  103 Ω cm, a mobility of 22 cm2 V1 s1, a carrier concentration of 1.02  1020 cm3 and a low absorption coefficient of 2.14  105 cm1 at 600 nm (Figs. 1a,b). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) characterization in Fig. 1c shows that the SnOx films have no characteristic peaks and appear amorphous, resulting in low surface roughness as seen by atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Fig. 1c, inset). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed to confirm the chemical composition of the films further. Figure 1d illustrates the typical core-level spectra of Sn 3d and O 1s. The Sn 3d spectrum depicts two spinorbit double peaks belonging to Sn4+ and Sn2+ respectively, where Sn4+ is located at 486.9 eV (Sn4+ 3d5/2) and 495.3 eV (Sn4+ 3d3/2), and Sn2+ is located at 486.2 eV (Sn2+ 3d5/2) and 494.6 eV (Sn2+ 3d3/2). In addition, the peak positions of Sn4+ and Sn2+ are separated by 0.7 eV and the gap between the Sn 3d5/2 and Sn 3d3/2 levels (8.4 eV) is essentially the same as in the standard spectrum of Sn. Furthermore, the O 1s peak can be fitted to two peaks, located at 530.05 eV and 530.72 eV, assigned to OSn2+ and OSn4+, respectively. The binding energies of all the components in this work are consist- ent with previously reported values14,15. The proportions of different species are presented in Supplementary Table 3. Quantification of the Sn 3d and O 1s peaks provides an average O/Sn atomic ratio of 1.81. This signifies the highly oxygen-deficient non-stoichiometric forma- tion of the SnOx film, which is why it can conduct electricity. The photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra of SnOx films are shown in Fig. 1e. The emission spectrum can be deconvoluted by Gauss- ian fitting into five peaks, centred at 366, 399, 448, 500 and 528 nm. As the band gap of SnOx films is approximately 3.73.9 eV, these emission peaks are mainly caused by various defects in the films. Among them, the origin of the emission peak at 399 nm is thought to be related to an oxygen vacancy16. Generally, there are three kinds of oxygen vacancies in SnOx films: V0 O (without any positive charges), V+ O (with a positive charge) and V++ O (with two positive charges)17. The following relation- ship exists between them: V0 O V+ O + e V+ O + h+ V++ O At room temperature, V0 O centres dissociate into V+ O centres and conduction band electrons. V+ O can combine with electrons shared by neighbouring Sn4+, and the energy level of V+ O is close to the conduction band, so the emission peak at 399 nm corresponds to the electron transition from V+ O donor levels to the valence band. At the same time, VO + can easily trap holes in the valence band to form V++ O . Nature Energy | Volume 8 | October 2023 | 11191125 1121 Article https://doi.org/10.1038/s41560-023-01331-7 the surface roughness of the bilayer films is smaller than that of the polycrystalline IMO:H films (Supplementary Fig. 8), which is because the upper part of the bilayer films is amorphous SnOx film with a smooth surface. This is consistent with the XRD pattern. Compared with a single layer of SnOx film, the bilayer film has a threefold increase in mobility and an increase in carrier concentration, reducing the resis- tivity of the bilayer films (Fig. 2b). The bilayer films retain both the good optical properties of the SnOx film and the excellent electrical properties of the IMO:H that ultimately exhibits better optical and electrical properties. In addition, considering that the films, as TEs, also need to have good stability in SHJ solar cells, we monitored the damp-heat (85 C and 85% humidity) stability (Supplementary Table 5) and thermal (200 C) stability (Supplementary Fig. 9) of SnOx, IMO:H and IMO:H+SnOx bilayer films. The results show that the parameters of SnOx and IMO:H+SnOx bilayer films change little after damp-heat and thermal annealing treatment. Compared with IMO:H, which has been widely used in industrialization, the stability of SnOx and IMO:H+SnOx bilayer films is not poor. On the basis of the above improvements in film performance, we applied the bilayer film to SHJ solar cells by replacing the front TE. The structure is shown in Fig. 2c. Because of the above properties, all the performance parameters of the solar cells were improved, especially the FF, compared with the SnOx monolayer film, which was attributed to the improved electrical and contact performance. Finally, a 25.71% (Voc = 748.34 mV, Jsc = 39.98 mA cm2, FF = 85.95%) efficiency SHJ solar cell was achieved (Fig. 2c,d). ρ (Ω cm) n (cm 3) µ (cm 2 V 1 s 1) Sample 2.38  10 3 1.02  10 20 22 SnOx film a b c Sample Eﬀiciency (%) FF (%) Jsc (mA cm 2) Voc (mV) SnOx 24.91 84.14 39.60 747.70 Screen-printed Ag grids SnOx n-µc-SiOx:H i-a-Si:H p-µc-Si:H IMO:H Screen-printed Ag grids d e 350 400 450 500 550 600 650 528 448 399 Intensity (a.u.)

Nature Energy | Volume 8 | October 2023 | 11191125 1122 Article https://doi.org/10.1038/s41560-023-01331-7 To further reduce the indium content and the production costs, we replaced the TEs on both sides of the SHJ solar cell with IMO:H+SnOx bilayer films. The cell structure is shown in Supplementary Fig. 10a. As with the replacement of the front TE with a single layer of SnOx film, the indium content of the solar cell is also reduced by 50%, while the efficiency is further improved up to 25.64% (Voc = 748.53 mV, Jsc = 40.05 mA cm2, FF = 85.51%) (Supplementary Fig. 10a,b). The improved electrical properties of the bilayer film resulted in a obvi- ous improvement in FF (Supplementary Fig. 11 and Supplementary Tables 6, 7), further narrowing the performance gap versus solar cells without replacement of the indium-based TEs, from 0.93% to 0.20%. In addition, we also monitored the stability of these solar cells (Supplementary Fig. 12). It can be seen that, after 90 days of placement and subsequent high intensity light treatment (80 suns, over 200 C), cells with IMO:H+SnOx bilayer films as double-sided TEs still retained high efficiency with almost no decay, which is as good as the stability of the standard cells with IMO:H TEs. Highly efficient and low-cost SHJ solar cells To further reduce the cost, the metal electrodes of solar cells were pre- pared using the electroplating process, replacing silver with copper. As the electroplating process requires plating and stripping processes22, the SHJ solar cells will then be subjected to strong acid plating solu- tion and alkali stripping solution. To test whether the bilayer films can withstand acid and alkali attack, the bilayer films deposited on glass substrates were immersed in plating solution and stripping solution, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 13). After corrosion by the plating and stripping solution, the opto-electrical properties of the bilayer material hardly changed obviously (Supplementary Fig. 14). Compared with IMO:H, the bilayer material was relatively more stable (Supplementary Tables 8 and 9). Subsequently, we immersed the prepared complete SHJ solar cells also in the plating and stripping solution respectively (Supplementary Fig. 15). The solar cells showed no apparent damage before and after corrosion (Supplementary Fig. 16). After testing, it was found that all the performance parameters of the SHJ solar cells remained virtually unchanged before and after corrosion (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Table 10). Moreover, the contact performance between IMO:H+SnOx and metal electrodes is almost the same as that between IMO:H and metal electrodes (Supplementary Table 11). On this basis, a highly efficient SHJ solar cell was prepared by replacing the silver electrode with a copper electrode, using an electroplating process (Fig. 3b). Subsequently, a champion efficiency of 25.94% (Voc = 747.5 mV, Jsc = 40.49 mA cm2, FF = 85.71%) was achieved for the SHJ solar cell with a MgF2 + SnOx + IMO:H + n-μc-SiOx:H front contact layer and a p-μc-Si:H + IMO:H + SnOx rear contact layer (Fig. 3c), which achieved the Institut für Solarenergieforschung CalTeC performance certifica- tion. This result is at the forefront of previous studies on SHJ solar cells based on indium-less TEs (Supplementary Table 12) or electroplated copper electrodes (Supplementary Table 13). This work demonstrates the feasibility of amorphous undoped SnOx TEs with copper electrodes as an alternative to indium-based TEs with silver electrodes, which provides an effective solution to address the high cost of silver paste and limited supply of rare indium. We believe that such amorphous undoped SnOx TEs that can be processed at room temperature are not only suitable for silicon solar cells but also perovskite and corresponding tandem devices.

Nature Energy | Volume 8 | October 2023 | 11191125 1123 Article https://doi.org/10.1038/s41560-023-01331-7 SnOx-derived materials are expected to have an attractive role in the fields of photoelectrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction and hydrogen evolution by water splitting. Methods Transparent conductive oxide Transparent conductive oxide (TCO) films were deposited by mag- netron sputtering on textured silicon (100) wafers or glass sub- strates. SnO2 planar ceramic targets with a target size of 1,000 mm (length)  125 mm (width) 9 mm (thickness) were used to prepare amorphous SnOx films. The oxygen concentration can be tuned by adjusting the gas ratio of pure argon and pure oxygen during the deposi- tion process. The base vacuum pressure in the chamber was 2  104 Pa, and the pressure during the sputtering process was set at 0.40.7 Pa. No additional heating was applied to the substrate during the deposi- tion process. The films were deposited using radio-frequency (RF), direct current (DC) or DC + RF. The DC + RF mode refers to a dual power control sputtering method. During sputtering, both direct and alter- nating voltages are applied between the cathode and anode, and the parameters of the two power modes can be adjusted independently. Indium oxide targets doped with transition metals were used to prepare IMO:H films, where M refers to three transition metal oxides of titanium oxide, cerium oxide and tantalum oxide. More details regard- ing the deposition process for IMO:H films can be found in previous work21. A bilayer film means the combination of SnOx and IMO:H films in a 1:1 thickness ratio, with the total thickness of the layer remaining unchanged. Note that the sputtering of the IMO:H layers was always done before the deposition of the SnOx layers. SHJ solar cells The equipment used in the solar cell preparation process in this paper is all home-made (including the equipment used in texturing and clean- ing, chemical vapour deposition, physical vapour deposition and screen printing). The solar cells were fabricated as follows. First, com- mercial n-type (100)-oriented Czochralski silicon wafers with a thick- ness of 150 μm and resistivity of 1 Ω cm were subjected to wet chemical treatment. Afterwards, 7 nm i-a-Si:H was deposited on both sides of the wafer as a passivation layer. Subsequently, 25 nm n-μc-SiOx:H and 36 nm p-μc-Si:H were deposited as the front contact layer and rear emitter, respectively.

After screen printing, the solar cells were annealed at 200 C for 20 min. The cop- per electrodes of the champion solar cell were prepared at SunDrive by bias-assisted light-induced plating. The plating duration was set to 10 min, resulting in an average deposited contact height of 13  1 μm. The cell area is 274.4 cm2. Corrosion resistance experiment The corrosion resistance experiment of TCO films mainly simulates the corrosion of films by plating solution and stripping solution in electroplating processes, and the corresponding verification is the acid and alkali resistance of the films. Among them, plating solution is mainly composed of cupric sulfate, sulfuric acid and chloride ion, at concentration of 120 g l1, 150 g l1 and 60 ppm, respectively. Strip- ping solution includes saccharin sodium and sodium hydroxide, at concentration of 50 g l1 and 1 g l1, respectively. According to the electroplating process, TCO films were soaked for 12 min and 160 s in plating solution and stripping solution, respectively, at room tem- perature and 5065 C. After soaking in solution, TCO films were rinsed with deionized water and blown dry, and then basic photoelectric properties were tested. Characterization The structural properties were measured by XRD (D8 ADVANCE, Bruker) using Cu Kα radiation in the conventional 2θθ test mode. Sur- face images of the films were detected by AFM (Dimension XR, Bruker). PL spectra were measured by using a fluorescence spectrometer (BT Imaging R2 Plus) at room temperature. The composition of the sam- ples was determined by XPS (ESCALAB Xi+, Thermo Fisher) using Mg Kα (1,253.6 eV) radiation. The transmittance and reflectance spectra were measured by using a spectrophotometer (LAMBDA 1050, PerkinElmer). The thickness of the films was measured by using an ellipsometer (SE 800 PV, Sentech). The sheet resistance was measured by the four-point probe method. The contact resistivity of SHJ solar cells was calculated using the Cox and Strack method.
