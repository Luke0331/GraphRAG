Diﬀractive Optics for thin-ﬁlm silicon solar cells Christian Stefano Schuster Doctor of Philosophy University of York Physics May 2015 Abstract Thin-ﬁlm silicon solar cells have the potential to convert sunlight into electricity at high eﬃciency, low cost and without generating pollutants. However, they need to become more competitive with conventional energy technologies by in- creasing their eﬃciency. One of the key eﬃciency limitations of using thin silicon absorber materials re- lates to the optical loss of low-energy photons, because the absorption coeﬃcient of silicon decreases strongly for these low-energy photons in the red and near- infrared, such that the absorption length becomes longer than the absorber layer thickness. If, in contrast, the incident light was redirected and trapped into the plane of the silicon slab, a thin-ﬁlm could absorb as much light as a thick layer. Diﬀractive textures can not only eﬃciently scatter the low-energy photons, but are also able to suppress the reﬂection of the incident sunlight. In order to take advantage of the full beneﬁts that textures can oﬀer, I outline a simple layer transfer technique that allows the structuring of a thin-ﬁlm independently from both sides, and use absorption measurements to show that structuring on both sides is favourable compared to structuring on one side only. I also introduce a ﬁgure-of-merit that can objectively and quantitatively assess the beneﬁt of the structuring itself, which allows me to benchmark state-of- the-art proposals and to deduce some important design rules. Minimising the parasitic losses, for example, is of critical importance, as the desired scattering properties are directly proportional to these losses. To study the impact of para- sitics, I quantify the useful absorption enhancement of two diﬀerent light trapping mechanisms, i.e. diﬀractive vs plasmonic, based on a fair and simple experimen- tal comparison. The experiment demonstrates that diﬀractive light-trapping is a better choice for photovoltaic applications, because plasmonic structures accu- mulate the parasitical losses by multiple interactions with the trapped light. The results of this thesis therefore highlight the importance of diﬀractive struc- tures as an eﬀective way of trapping more light in a thinner solar cell device, and will help to deﬁne guidelines for new designs that may overcome the 30% power conversion eﬃciency limit. ii Contents Abstract ii Contents iii List of Figures viii List of Tables xi Acknowledgements xiii Declaration of Authorship xvi 1

Solar cells can generate power in remote ar- eas, because they do not rely on energy sources other than sunlight. In principle, the average sunshine over an area only as large as Wales (UK) would already be suﬃcient to supply the worlds electricity needs.Photovoltaics thus has a great potential to address the worlds energy requirement in the long run, in contrast to conventional resources, which are either ﬁnite or which generate pollutants. However, in order to compete with conventional energy technologies, solar cells still need to prove higher power conversion eﬃciencies and lower costs. own calculations, based on 2.4 kWh/m2 on an average day from sun 1 Chapter 1. Introduction 2 If I ﬁrst consider what limits the conversion eﬃciency of sunlight into electricity, optical losses are identiﬁed as one of the main loss mechanisms, which will be the focus of this thesis. Thermal loss mechanisms, such as Joule heating, are another key factor aﬀecting the power conversion eﬃciency. The need for good electrical transport properties does not tolerate material impurities or fabrication imperfections, hence electrical loss mechanisms are also important, especially as the cost-pressure in the solar industry makes it often too expensive for industry to use high purity materials. While my work does not explicitly address the electrical loss mechanisms, I note that the optical light trapping techniques studied in this thesis allow us to use less material, thereby reducing the impact of material defects, as thinner ﬁlms make it easier for charge carriers to be collected. I also note that a more eﬃcient usage of silicon is not the cost driver any more, because the raw material now is only 20% of the module cost and less than 10% of the total cost of a photovoltaic system [1]. As performance increases and manufacturing costs decline over time, the ratio of cost to performance, expressed in US Dollars per peak Watt generated by a module (US$/Wp), is taken as a standardized ﬁgure-of-merit to quantify the improvements in photovoltaics. Figure 1.1 uses this deﬁnition to illustrate how photovoltaics has continued to follow a trend, that makes the technology ever more competitive, especially as the cost of fossil fuels tends to increase (despite the drop in oil price in 2015), leading now to grid parity in the southern part of Europe [2]. Grid parity means that the cost of solar electricity is equal to the cost of electricity from the national grid transmission network. If research and development in photovoltaics aims to follow this trend curve, neither high eﬃciency nor cost reduction is suﬃcient to displace the current technology. I cite two examples to illustrate this point. 1. High eﬃciency. Using a 1 µm thick GaAs slab, the US based company Alta Devices set a world record eﬃciency of 29%. Nevertheless, high eﬃciency is not enough, as the GaAs slab is more expensive to produce than comparable silicon cells (in terms of US$/Wp). Hence, these world record cells are now not used in solar farms, but in consumer electronics instead, where surface area is premium. Alta Devices was recently sold to the Chinese company Hanergy, who intend to use this technology as a solar gadget [3]. Chapter 1. Introduction 3 2. Cost reduction. Nanosolar, Abound Solar and Solyndra tried to commer- cialize low-cost solar modules. The companies were able to increase the throughput of their manufacturing plants by improving the speed of their deposition process, producing high quality CIGS and CdTe material very eﬃciently. When the modules were ready for the market, the prices for crystalline silicon modules had dropped in the meantime, and the loss of cost advantage ultimately forced the companies to shutdown [4]. A new development in photovoltaics therefore needs to move below the trend curve of silicon wafers; in order to be competitive and to justify investments. One way to achieve this is to reduce the material thickness, thereby reducing material cost, while maintaining cell eﬃciency. This is the strategy of the US company Solexel [5], who are aiming to introduce a 22% eﬃcient silicon solar cell with only 35 µm silicon thickness, aiming for 0.42 US$/Wp. This means that their cells would be as eﬃcient or better than State-of-the-Art bulk silicon cells, while costs are lower. Their cell rely on light-trapping, i.e. on increasing the absorption length by eﬃciently scattering the light inside the cell. Fig. 1.1: The ratio of cost to generated power in US$/Wp is used to quantify the improvement in photovoltaics. The graph illustrates the case of silicon wafer technology, which represents ca. 90% of the global market share. The trend curve is indicated by a black line and highlights the rapid growth rate of the cumulative capacity worldwide: for each doubling of production volume, the average selling price of solar modules has fallen by 20% [2]. Chapter 1. Introduction 4 1.3 Light trapping for thin ﬁlm silicon solar cells Light trapping aims to overcome the problem of low absorption of red and near- infrared photons (the NIR problem) in silicon. This low absorption is a particular problem for thin silicon absorbers. I will ﬁrst analyse the problem in terms of the optical depth that deﬁnes the onset of photon absorption, i.e. the optical bandgap of a material. Light-trapping can then be understood as a means of lowering the optical bandgap of silicon. This interpretation will allow me to provide a more general discussion about the potential beneﬁt of light-trapping in terms of higher power conversion eﬃciencies. 1.3.1 The NIR problem The near-infrared (NIR) problem stands for the loss of opacity by a thinner silicon slab. If the amount of material is reduced, low-energy photons are less likely to be absorbed, because they require a longer absorption length in a silicon slab compared to more energetic photons. In order to distinguish the threshold for photon absorption from the electronic bandgap Eg, authors often quote the optical bandgap Eo instead. Although both quantities are understood as independent of the absorber thickness, thin- ﬁlm silicon solar cells suﬀer from optical losses in the NIR, because the onset Eo essentially depends on the layer thickness, as illustrated in Fig. 1.2 for silicon. The thickness dependence of Eo is caused by the indirect nature of the electronic bandgap. In an indirect bandgap material such as silicon, a transition always involves both photons and phonons, as schematically shown in Fig. 1.3. If an electron absorbs a photon, it ﬁrst occupies a metastable state within the bandgap from where it will then scatter into the conduction band via phonon interaction. The wavelength dependent absorption coeﬃcient α(λ) could thus be derived from the probability of all relevant inter-particle interactions [6]. In consequence, transitions between the valence and conduction band are less likely compared to a direct bandgap material like GaAs, because direct transitions do not require phonon interactions. Chapter 1. Introduction 5 Fig. 1.2: The optical bandgap Eo is deﬁned as the threshold for photon absorption (A  0.1 %), i.e. when the optical depth τdB = 10  log (1 A) exceeds 0.01 dB, which is cited as the theoretical loss factor of modern optical ﬁbre communication [7]. The optical depth is the product of the absorber thickness and the wavelength dependent absorption coeﬃcient. The thinner the silicon absorber layer, the lower the optical depth and the higher the optical bandgap, consequently, the more low-energy photons will pass through the medium without being absorbed. Chapter 1. Introduction 6 Fig. 1.3: In a semiconductor with indirect bandgap Eg, like silicon, the charge carriers in the valence and conduction band diﬀer by a (reciprocal) lattice vector k. Since momentum has to be conserved in band-to-band transitions, the absorption of a photon with energy Eγ requires the supply of a lattice vibration (phonon) with momentum kΓ and energy EΓ. The optical threshold is then given by Eγ = Eg EΓ. The phonon energy is usually small, and tends to get neglected at room temperature (EΓ Eg). Since the probability of a transition scales as the slab thickness d, the product αd is called the optical depth of a medium τ(λ)  d Z 0 α(λ, x)  dx (1.1) and is expressed in units of decibels. The optical depth quantiﬁes the opacity of a material for a particular wavelength. For example, a medium is called transparent when its optical depth is 0 dB for radiation passing through it. Reducing the absorber thickness while maintaining a high optical depth is therefore a key goal of light-trapping. The optical depth, for a given material thickness, can be increased by increasing the path integral in Eq. 1.1. For example, the addition of light trapping increases the path inside the absorber material, thereby increasing the path integral and the optical depth. Since a larger optical depth translates into a higher absorption, especially of low energy photons, light-trapping can be understood as a means of lowering the optical bandgap Eo. Chapter 1. Introduction 7 It is then a valid question, whether and to what extend the potential beneﬁt of a lower optical bandgap translates into a higher power conversion eﬃciency of a silicon solar cell. The impact of light-trapping on the power conversion eﬃciency is therefore analysed next. 1.3.2 The light-trapping potential Solar cells convert the absorbed solar energy into an electric charge with the potential to drive a load. The maximum potential energy that can be delivered to a load is estimated by the energy eVoc when the load remains unconnected in the electric circuit, i.e. at open circuit conditions. If a solar cell is operated at open circuit, the converted energy from sunlight can neither generate an electric current ﬂow nor deliver a voltage across the load. Consequently, all the energy absorbed from the sun would be balanced (ideally) by an equivalent emitted en- ergy ﬂux back towards the sun, which is well-known as Kirchhoﬀs equilibrium law of radiation. Since the rate at which photons are absorbed is then equal to their rate of emission, the photons in the absorber are in a thermodynamic equilibrium with the excited charge carriers. In this equilibrium, the probability of creating an electron-hole pair e + h (by the absorption of a photon) must be equal to the probability of photon emission γ (by the recombination of an electron-hole pair): γ  e + h Since the potential for a particle to undergo a reaction is quantiﬁed by its chem- ical potential, the chemical potential of the emitted photons µγ in the absorber must be equal to the chemical potential of the electron-hole pairs, which is the maximum potential energy that can be delivered to a load eVoc, µγ = eVoc in photon equilibrium, assuming no heat loss occurs. P. Wurfel [8] explains this chemical equilibrium in analogy to a hypothetical hydrogen fuel cell, where water molecules are split Chapter 1. Introduction 8 by high-energy photons into oxygen and twice as many hydrogen molecules. As long as the decomposition occurs at the same rate as the reverse reaction, and neither water, hydrogen nor oxygen molecules are removed (closed system), the chemical potential of all reaction partners is non-zero under irradiation. The average number of photons in a certain energy interval is given by the Bose- Einstein distribution function, such that the ﬂow equilibrium (Kirchhoﬀrelation- ship) between absorbed and emitted photons now reads  Z Eo A(ε) ε2 e ε/kBTS 1  dε   Z Eo A(ε) ε2 e(ε eVoc)/kBT 1  dε. (1.2) Here, A stands for the silicon absorption, ε for the photon energy, Eo is the optical bandgap or the threshold for photon absorption, kB the Boltzmann constant, T the temperature of the absorber and TS the temperature of the sun. For silicon, it is Eo eVoc kBT and Eq. 1.2 simpliﬁes to  Z Eo A(ε) ε2 e ε/kBTS 1  dε eeVoc/kBT   Z Eo A(ε) ε2 eε/kBT  dε. (1.3) If at open circuit, the illuminated absorber is in a non-thermal equilibrium with the surroundings, the Voc quantiﬁes the oﬀset from the thermal-equilibrium situa- tion: the larger the Voc, the greater the photon emission rate at constant absorber temperature T. In order to quantify the eﬀect of light trapping on the open-circuit voltage Voc, the analysis of the Kirchhoﬀrelationship is more conveniently formulated in terms of electric currents, instead of the absorbed and emitted photon ﬂuxes (Eq. 1.3): 1. The number of absorbed photons is measured by a solar cell under short circuit conditions, i.e. when the absorbed solar energy is converted into an electric current without potential energy to drive a load eVoc = 0. In conse- quence, the short-circuit current Isc also quantiﬁes the maximum number of emitted photons when all photogenerated charge carriers recombine at open circuit conditions (under solar illumination), i.e. the left hand side of Eq. 1.3. Chapter 1. Introduction 9 2. As in a thermal equilibrium the electron-hole pairs are coupled to the phonons, the potential of the photons µγ in the absorber must also be equal to the potential of the phonon system µγ 0 in phonon equilibrium, since the energy per phonon is negligible small. The maximum number of thermally excited electrons and holes is measured by the short-circuit current Id in a dark environment. Consequently, the short-circuit current Id also quantiﬁes the maximum number of emitted photons when all thermally excited charge carriers recombine at open circuit conditions (in a dark environment), which is given by the right hand side of Eq. 1.3 with eVoc = 0. From Eq. 1.3, it now follows that the knowledge of Eo and A ﬁxes the open- circuit voltage Voc. However, Eo and A also deﬁne the ideal short-circuit current under light conditions Isc, which is given by the left hand side of Eq. 1.3, and under dark conditions Id, which is given by the right hand side of Eq. 1.3 with eVoc = 0. Together, this yields: Isc(Eo) Id(Eo)  exp  eVoc kBT  = Voc ln Isc(Eo) Id(Eo)  (1.4) The open-circuit voltage therefore increases with a higher photon emission rate in photon equilibrium (nominator) or with a lower photon emission rate in phonon equilibrium (denominator). The maximum potential energy that can be delivered to a load is thus a measure of the highest operating point of a solar cell away from its thermal equilibrium position  because this equilibrium is perturbed at open-circuit conditions by sunlight. Since light-trapping aims to enhance the absorption properties A of a thin-ﬁlm by lowering its optical bandgap Eo, it enhances both the absorption rate of photons from the sun (a) and the emission rate of photons into the surroundings (b): a) The absorption enhancement in the spectral region of the optical bandgap Eo is favourable in terms of electric current, because more charge carriers will be generated under sunlight (higher Isc). Chapter 1. Introduction 10 b) The absorption enhancement in the spectral region of the optical bandgap Eo, however, also increases the number of excited charge carriers under dark conditions (higher Id), thus enhances the photon emission of thermally excited charge carriers and hence reduces the oﬀset between the phonon and the photon equilibrium. Accordingly, light trapping is then unfavourable in terms of voltage. In fact, Sandhu et al. [9, 10] present a modelling approach of nanophotonic solar cells that elucidates the physics of open- circuit voltage enhancement; they indeed show, that the enhancement was related to the absorption suppression in the immediate spectral region of the bandgap. I am now able to discuss the potential beneﬁt of light-trapping in terms of power conversion eﬃciencies: while the incident optical power of the AM1.5G solar spectrum is 100 mW/cm2, the converted power is proportional to the product of Isc and Voc. I therefore calculated the short-circuit current Isc and open-circuit voltage by solving Eq. 1.3 for Voc, using the intrinsic material function for silicon [11], the standard AM1.5G solar spectrum and an ambient spectrum at temper- ature 300 K. The outcome is shown in Fig. 1.4 and allows to study the electrical performance as a function of light trapping. In summary, I answered the question, whether and to what extend light-trapping aﬀects the principal operation of a silicon solar cell device by considering Kirch- hoﬀs radiation law and the thickness dependency of the optical bandgap: light- trapping in the NIR increases the optical depth and thereby the short-circuit current of a silicon slab, while it reduces the limiting open-circuit voltage at the same time. However, as the current enhancement is larger than the reduction in voltage, light-trapping proves to be an eﬀective solution for the NIR-problem and allows to achieve higher power conversion eﬃciencies. For example, the eﬃciency of a 6 µm thin-ﬁlm of silicon would improve by 25%, if light trapping allows to reduce its optical bandgap by 4%, i.e. from 1.19 eV (1040 nm wavelength) to 1.14 eV (1090 nm wavelength). Chapter 1. Introduction 11 Fig. 1.4: The beneﬁts of light-trapping for solar cells. Light-trapping is able to lower the absorption threshold, to increase the photon absorption in the NIR and, therefore, very attractive for thin-ﬁlm silicon solar cells with Eo  Eg. Here, the optical bandgap Eo of silicon is used as a measure for the degree of light-trapping (bottom axis); the higher the absorption, the lower Eo. For comparison, the dependence of Isc and Voc on the optical depth for a single traversal is shown as a function of the absorber thickness (top axis). While light-trapping directly translates into a higher short-circuit current Isc (red solid lines), it tends to reduce the open-circuit voltage Voc (blue solid lines) due to the enhanced emission of photons close to Eo. The black dotted line refers to the power conversion eﬃciency under 1 sun illumination, which is proportional to the product of Isc and Voc. Light trapping proves to be an eﬀective solution to achieve higher power conversion eﬃciencies, because the eﬃciency scales with a lower optical bandgap. All calculations are based on ideal conditions, i.e. zero surface reﬂection, a perfect mirror at the back side, no electrical loss mechanisms and a maximum possible ﬁll-factor of 88% [12]. Chapter 1. Introduction 12 1.4 Scope & outline of this thesis As light trapping for thin-ﬁlm solar cells has attracted a lot of research interest over the last few decades, I ﬁrst present an overview over some of the main light trapping techniques in chapter 2 before focussing on diﬀractive light trapping approaches. In general, light-trapping aims to increase the material absorption of incident sunlight, which naturally leads to the question of whether or not a limiting ab- sorption enhancement factor exists. Comparing the performance of a structure against such a limiting value can then help to establish some design rules for light-trapping structures. Therefore, I will introduce and analyze the Lambertian Scatter as a useful benchmark model and a general method for the assessment of a structure, which is independent of the material, fabrication method or technol- ogy used. Applying the method to numerous proposals found in the literature then allowed me to identify the most promising light-trapping structures. Next, in chapter 3 and section 3.4, I will introduce the methodological aspects for the fabrication and characterization of the structures used in my experiments. Although most of my diﬀractive structures are realized via electron beam lithog- raphy and dry etching techniques, I will also show how nanostructures can be made by nanomiprint lithography. To this end, I designed, constructed and suc- cessfully tested a home-made UV nanoimprint lithography tool. Chapter 4 ﬁnally outlines two key experiments performed in my PhD project. The ﬁrst experiment highlights a simple, eﬀective but novel layer transfer tech- nique. In a proof-of-principle, I demonstrated the ability to pattern a silicon thin-ﬁlm independently from both sides. My technique could support the study of more eﬃcient light trapping designs without being constraint by design param- eters. The second experiment concentrates on a fair assessment of two diﬀerent light-trapping mechanisms, i.e. diﬀractive vs plasmonic. This comparison is jointly undertaken with colleagues from the University of Catania and it high- lights the importance of avoiding any optical loss mechanisms in novel light- trapping designs. The global conclusions of my work, some critical remarks and possible future developments are then presented in chapter 5. Chapter 2 Nanostructures for enhanced light-trapping in thin-ﬁlm silicon solar cells 2.1 Introduction The demand for low-cost, high-eﬃciency solar cells along with the never-ending promises of modern technology have caused an increase of research into photo- voltaics, particularly into the control of light at the subwavelength scale. In fact, the now well known Shockley & Queisser paper about the limiting eﬃciency of solar cells [13] was a sleeping beauty for almost 40 years of slow reception [14]. Accordingly, a multiplicity of light-trapping concepts has been proposed with the intent of enhancing the optical depth of thin-ﬁlm absorbers; the more light- trapping approaches are developed, the more marketable options will be explored, with the more promising ones having an impact on thin-ﬁlm solar cells: nanopho- tonis therefore drives the vision of a new generation of photovoltaic devices. Before I focus on the diﬀractive designs I pursued in my project, I will ﬁrst give a brief overview of the main techniques in section 2.2. I then analyse the model of an ideal scattering structure in section 2.3, called Lambertian texture, which led me to introduce a ﬁgure-of-merit in section 2.4, called the light-trapping 13 Chapter 2. Light trapping in a slab 14 eﬃciency (LTE), that can purely assess the performance of a light-trapping technique itself  irrespective of the material, fabrication method and technology used. Before I apply the LTE to state-of-the-art proposals to identify the most promising strategies, I will review the important milestones of light-trapping for photovoltaics in section 2.5 and ﬁnally conclude with some speciﬁc remarks regarding future trends in section 2.6. 2.2 The main light-trapping approaches 2.2.1 Non-diﬀractive techniques Maximizing the surface-to-volume ratio is the most intuitive way of enhancing the probability of photon absorption. Silicon nanowires are examples for such light-trapping strategies, where the electronic transport properties may addition- ally beneﬁt from a radial junction, as illustrated in Fig. 2.1. Solar cell devices with conversion eﬃciencies of around 12% were reported for a nanowire junction geometry [15, 16], whereas the use of nanowires as an anti-reﬂection texture for 300 µm thick substrates enabled device eﬃciencies of 18% [17, 18]. Fig. 2.1: Schematic of a Heterojunction with Intrinsic Thin Layer (HIT) radial junction silicon solar cell with 10% power conversion eﬃciency [19]. A 30tilted top-view image of a fabricated device is shown in the inset. The indicated scale bar as well as the pillars length are 10 µm. Chapter 2. Light trapping in a slab 15 However, too many research challenges still need to be addressed, before a com- mercial product based on nanowires can be introduced: mainly, the stability of the junction formation and the eﬀective surface passivation, but also practical issues, such as the rapid scaling and the integration of nanowires into modules, need to be better understood and further improved. Another method for enhancing the photon absorption takes advantage of the plasmonic resonance of metal nanoparticles. Metal nanoparticles can exhibit a very high polarizability at the resonance wavelength, and eﬃciently scatter the incident light into the thin-ﬁlm. Here, the particle dimensions are a key param- eter for the tuning of the resonance condition. Solar cells with plasmonic scatterers have attracted a lot of attention [20], but the proposed eﬀect turned out to be very sensitive to the material parameters. While enhancements of up to 30% in the power conversion eﬃciency were re- ported for plasmonic thin-ﬁlm silicon solar cells, the absolute power conversion eﬃciency remained below 10% [2125]. One of the issues I study later (see section 4.3) is the dissipative loss of such plas- monic structures; therefore, if the plasmonic scatterers were replaced by dielectric structures, the dissipative optical losses could be greatly reduced. In fact, dielectric Mie resonators were recently proposed by Spinelli et al. [26]. The authors could demonstrate almost perfect impedance matching from the ul- traviolet to the near-infrared spectral range using Si nanopillar arrays, i.e. less than 3% reﬂectivity was obtained over the entire spectral range 450 900 nm by 150 nm long nanowires with a 0.5 µm array pitch and 60 nm thick Si3N4 overlay coating. To characterize the wavelength dependent scattering eﬃciency Qsca, the scatter- ing cross section σsca is usually normalized to the geometrical area of the structure σgeom. For dielectric Mie resonators, scattering eﬃciencies Qsca = σsca/σgeom up to 10 have been demonstrated so far [26]. In addition, it has also been demonstrated that Mie-resonators could even be placed on top of an already completely ﬁnished thin-ﬁlm solar cell for enhancing its power conversion eﬃciency [27]. Chapter 2. Light trapping in a slab 16 Fig. 2.2: Long silicon nanowires (4 µm long) and arrays of small nanopillars (150 nm high) have both shown to yield excellent anti-reﬂective properties. While the high-aspect ratio of closely spaced silicon nanowires (a) notably reduces the external back-reﬂection [28], dielectric Mie-scatterers (b) are able to strongly enhance the coupling eﬃciency of incident light into the absorber layer [26]. The Mie resonance of metallic nanostructures may in principal be superior to dielectric scatterers, given the high polarizability of localized plasmonic particles. In practice, however, the parasitic losses tend to almost compensate the beneﬁt of the plasmonic scatterers. Please note that the best performing plasmonic structure in [29], here shown as image (c), looks quite similar to one of my own best performing diﬀractive textures, here shown as image (d), which made me wondering about the mechanism of the improved light trapping performance. Thin and transparent dielectric coatings are a further and well-known anti- reﬂective technique. Commonly used materials are SiOx, Si3N4, and some con- ductive oxides like SnO2, ZnO or tin-doped indium oxide (ITO) to name but a few [30]. Since the Fresnel-reﬂection R = n1 n2 n1 + n2 2 (2.1) strongly depends on the refractive index contrast of two bordering media with refractive indices n1 an n2, an intermediate buﬀer layer can be used to reduce the reﬂection. For example, if a coating with refractive index nAR = n1  n2 is Chapter 2. Light trapping in a slab 17 chosen a quarter wavelength thick λ/4nAR, the incident and reﬂected waves will largely cancel each other out by destructive interference. Anti-reﬂective coatings can thus be understood as optical-impedance matching layers at the interface between two bordering materials, e.g. air/semiconductor. Ideally, the refractive index would vary continuously in the transition region from air to silicon, because one single coating can not meet the requirement for a broadband anti-reﬂective quality. Such an inhomogeneous refractive index proﬁle is approximated by multiple coatings, increasing the refractive index stepwise. A triple layer system of ZnS/MgF2/SiO2, for example, has shown to reduce the silicon reﬂectance down to 2% in the wavelength range from 440 to 960 nm [31]. However, the fabrication of such multilayer coatings is often too expensive for most commercial solar cells. In addition, the anti-reﬂection eﬀect is very sensitive to the layers thickness as well as to the angle of the incident light. For oblique incident light, the performance of thin ﬁlm coatings can indeed dramatically change. 2.2.2 Refractive approaches A varying refractive index at the interface of two bordering materials may be mimicked by a surface texture. The eye of a moth, for example, is inherently covered with sub-wavelength cone-shaped structures, helping moths to evade detection by predators and maximizing light capture for vision. For wavelengths much larger than the typical feature sizes, the eﬀect can be understood by a breakdown of the texture into multiple layers; the aspect-ratio thereby corresponds to the transition region from air to silicon. Approximately, and in analogy to anti-reﬂection multi-layer coatings, such textures can be de- scribed as a medium with an eﬀective index stepwise increasing from air to silicon, as illustrated in Fig. 2.3a. On the other hand, textures with dimensions of a few tens of micrometer can also reduce the external reﬂection of sunlight. If the wavelengths are much smaller than the structural feature sizes, radiation will generally bounce onto the textured surface multiple times (rather than out to the surrounding air), as illustrated in Fig. 2.3b. Chapter 2. Light trapping in a slab 18 In addition, light changes its propagation direction when entering a diﬀerent material, since the speed of light depends on the medium. The eﬀect is called refraction (from the Latin word refringere) following the fact that an object partly in one medium and partly in another medium appears to be broken, e.g. a stick that is partly submersed in the water. Refraction at surface textures therefore appears as a natural choice for enhancing the properties of a solar cell, because it aﬀords the redirection of sunlight into the absorber layer without incurring additional losses. The surface of most commer- cial crystalline silicon solar cells are indeed textured with anti-reﬂective/refractive pyramids similar to those shown in Fig. 2.3c. In conclusion, refractive textures in combination with sub-wavelength features (as those shown in Fig. 2.4) may enable eﬃcient light-trapping action over a broad spectral and angular range. On the basis of this idea, Han et al. recently outlined an economical way for suppressing the surface reﬂection of a polished silicon wafer from 30% to 3% between 400 and 900 nm wavelength [32], as illustrated in Fig. 2.4. Fig. 2.3: (a) If the typical feature sizes are smaller than the incident wave- length, light will see the texture as an inhomogeneous medium with an eﬀective refractive index gradually increasing from air to silicon. In analogy to a multi- layer anti-reﬂection coating, this eﬀect reduces the reﬂection dramatically. (b) If the typical feature sizes are larger than the incident wavelength, light will usually undergo multiple reﬂections on the textured surface, which in turn increases its probability of entering the absorber material. Since light is also refracted at the air-silicon interface, the path length through the absorber slab will be longer compared to the ﬂat surface situation. (c) Large square- based random pyramids often form the surface of an appropriately textured crystalline silicon solar cell [33], exploiting both anti-reﬂective and refractive eﬀects in order to enhance sunlight absorption. Chapter 2. Light trapping in a slab 19 Fig. 2.4: Aperiodic refractive microstructures in combination with moth- eye sub-wavelength textures can provide excellent anti-reﬂection properties according to B. Blasi [34] (left image) and S. Han et al. [32] (right image). 2.2.3 Diﬀractive approaches Light is redirected when it bounces oﬀa barrier (reﬂection) or goes from one medium to another (refraction). However, light may also change its propagation direction as it passes through an opening or around an obstacle in its path. Since the incident light thereby breaks up into diﬀerent directions, the phenomenon is called diﬀraction (from the Latin word diﬀringere). Consequently, light can be diﬀracted at a surface texture, if its ridges and growths are understood as the openings and obstacles. Augustin-Jean Fresnel [35] was ﬁrst able to explain diﬀraction as the resulting interference pattern of waves that were formed behind openings or obstacles. The superposition of all diﬀracted waves is commonly known as the diﬀraction pattern; mathematically, it is derived from a Fourier-transform of the diﬀracting structure. In order to exploit diﬀractive eﬀects, the typical structural sizes Λ need to be similar to the incident wavelength λ as illustrated in Fig. 2.5. For example, radiowaves can bend around mountains in contrast to microwave (mobile phone) signals. Bats echo calls are rather reﬂected than diﬀracted from their prey (λ Λ), whereas an object would be impossible to resolve when it is smaller than the wavelength with which it is observed (λ Λ). Chapter 2. Light trapping in a slab 20 Fig. 2.5: The drawings illustrate three possible interactions for wavefronts of light  coming from a distant source  with the opening of a barrier. (a) If the wavelength is much smaller than the slit width, light propagation can be approximated by geometrical ray optics. (b) If the wavelength is of similar size than the slit width, light will interfere and form a diﬀraction pattern behind the slit. The wavefronts of the constructive interfering waves are indicated as small bars. (c) If the wavelength is much larger than the slit width, the slit is considered as a source of a new propagating wave behind the slit. If the degree of diﬀraction depends on the relationship between λ and Λ, white sunlight can split into its colours when it interacts with a diﬀractive structure. Ideally, a diﬀractive structure on the surface of a silicon solar cell would deﬂect the longer wavelengths into the plane of the silicon absorber, because those wave- lenghts require absorption lengths often beyond the absorber thickness. If the silicon slab is further embedded in a low-index material, like air, diﬀracted light may also be totally internally reﬂected back at the cladding. In this case, light is trapped in the plane of the silicon absorber layer  the key goal that light trapping tries to achieve. A thin-ﬁlm silicon solar cell with a light-trapping nanostructure then behaves similarly to a waveguide and the nanostructure can be understood as the coupling interface for sunlight. 2.2.3.1 The grating equation Since diﬀraction results in a change in direction, the incident photon needs to exchange momentum with the grating. The energy and momentum of the inci- dent photon must thereby be conserved, while  in analogy to the crystal lattice momentum in a solid  the transfer of a grating momentum G is restricted to Chapter 2. Light trapping in a slab 21 integer multiples m of G, which is directed parallel to the gratings surface: k  sin θin + m  G = k  sin θm with G = 2π a (2.2) Here, a is the spatial period of the grating structure and θin and θm are the incident angle and diﬀraction angle of the mth-order, respectively, as illustrated in Fig. 2.6. The angles are deﬁned as positive when measured counter-clockwise. If λ stands for the free-space wavelength of light, k = 2π/λ for the wave-number and n1 and n2 are the wavelength dependent refractive indices of the incident and the propagating medium, respectively, rearranging the grating-equation explicitly highlights the dispersive character of a grating, because θm directly depends on the incident wavelength λ : n1(λ)  sin θin + m  λ a = n2(λ)  sin θm. (2.3) The grating-equation in this form would suggest to reconcile diﬀraction as an extension of Snells refraction law, which is reproduced for m = 0 in Eq. 2.3. This idea was indeed recently discussed by S. Larouche and D. Smith [36], who were able to establish a formal equivalence between generalized refraction and blazed diﬀraction gratings. 2.2.3.2 Discussion By assuming normal incidence θin = 0, solving the grating equation for the highest diﬀraction order |m|  a λ/n2(λ) for θm = π/2 (2.4) and for the diﬀraction angle θm, where the bijection arcsin(sin x) = x can be applied on x = θm, because θm is in the interval (π/2, +π/2) for transmission into medium n2, θm = arcsin λ/n2(λ) a/m  (2.5) Chapter 2. Light trapping in a slab 22 Fig. 2.6: Diﬀraction of an incident plane wave with wavelength λ and wave- number k = 2π/λ at a structured interface layer between a medium with refractive index n1 and medium with refractive index n2. While k remains conserved during the interaction, diﬀraction requires a transfer of momentum with the grating structure. The periodicity of the grating, however, restricts the momentum transfer to integer multiples m of 2π/a and to directions within the periodic corrugations a. The important correlation between the momentum of a wave and the periodicity of a system is often explained as Bloch-theorem in solid state physics textbooks [37] and photonic crystal books [38]. The higher diﬀraction orders are thus the result of a stronger interaction with the periodic structure. allows to draw the following two conclusions: although the number of diﬀraction orders m(λ) scales with the grating period a (see Eq. 2.4), the diﬀraction angle θm(λ) drops for wavelengths λ= λ/n2 smaller than a (see Eq. 2.5). Therefore, the more diﬀraction orders exist, the more light is diﬀracted into smaller angles. In addition, each order only contains a small fraction of the total intensity, when the energy is spread over a continuum of diﬀraction orders. On the other hand, choosing periods equal to a few wavelengths λwill result in more intensive, but only a few diﬀraction orders. Since the lower diﬀraction orders tend to be more intense, a promising strategy for enhancing the absorption of light aims to shift the energy from the lower to the higher orders, as these are more likely to be totally (internally) reﬂected at the cladding of a silicon slab. No optical losses would result, because the energy is only redistributed amongst the diﬀraction orders. Chapter 2. Light trapping in a slab 23 In eﬀect, this strategy strongly relies on the ability to control the phase of in- terfering waves. Changing the duty cycle is one example of how the absence of a diﬀraction order can be achieved. For example, if the ridges are half (or a third) of the gratings period, the second (or third) order will be suppressed by destructive interference. While diﬀractive eﬀects are only of minor importance in commercial solar cells today, nanophotonic structures are expected to enter the market soon. According to J. Harris (Stanford University), advisory board member from Solexel, nano- dome patterns or truncated pyramids (U.S. Patent No. 8853521) are now used in commercial 40 µm thin-ﬁlm silicon solar cells in order to obtain broadband and wide angle anti-reﬂection action. Solexel already announced the introduction of very lightweight and cheap solar modules for this year  with module eﬃciencies above 20 %. 2.3 The Lambertian Scatterer In order to assess a light-trapping structure, the performance of a given design has to be benchmarked against a theoretical limit. In this section, I will analyze the model of an ideal scattering structure, called Lambertian texture, which led me to introduce the ﬁgure-of-merit described in subsection 2.4.2. Light is reﬂected or refracted (or both) at a non-structured interface, whereas a structured interface may additionally scatter the radiation into higher angular directions. The concept of haze is one possible way to assess the beneﬁts of a structured surface, because the haze value quantiﬁes the percentage of non-refracted light. The more light is scattered, the higher the haze value would be. Consequently, more light experiences a longer path through the absorber as opposed to the sit- uation of a non-structured interface (for which the haze value is zero). Achieving high haze over a broad range of wavelengths is therefore a desirable objective for enhancing the absorption of a thin silicon slab. Chapter 2. Light trapping in a slab 24 However, if the path lengths of scattered and refracted light do not diﬀer by much, a high haze value may not necessarily translate into a higher absorption. Therefore, haze alone is not a suﬃcient requirement for characterising an eﬀective light trapping structure. A better parameter is path length enhancement: the greater the scattering angle θ, the longer the path ℓthrough the absorber. I can then deﬁne the scattering eﬃciency in terms of the path length enhancement ℓ/d with d representing the slab thickness: ℓ= d/ cos θ = d  sec θ. (2.6) The question of the maximum path length enhancement in a weakly absorbing slab was analyzed by E. Yablonovitch and G. Cody [39], who assumed the scat- tering layer to be isotropically radiating; such textures are called Lambertian, because their angular intensity distribution (AID) obeys Lamberts cosine law [40], see Fig. 2.7. The Lambertian Scatterer represents the perfect diﬀuser in the ray-optics approximation, with the radiated energy being understood to ﬂow in straight lines. Fig. 2.7: If a scatterer radiates isotropically into a material, the light would be transmitted equally in all directions with a lobe in the shape of a hemi- sphere. The angular intensity distribution (AID) thereby obeyes Lamberts cosine law [40], whereas the energy will in average ﬂow into the scattering an- gle ϑ = arccos  cos 0+ cos 90 2  = 60(indicated by the orange scattered rays) independently of the the incident light, c.f. Fig. 2.10 on page 33. Chapter 2. Light trapping in a slab 25 The light path is deﬁned in the framework of geometric optics. If the wavelength λbecomes comparable to both the absorber thickness and typical feature size of the surface Λ, near-ﬁeld phenomena will modify the diﬀracted waves. The Frauenhofer distance df = 2Λ2/λis a parameter often used for distinguishing the near and far-ﬁeld zones from each other. Since the thickness of silicon solar cells always exceeds df 2 µm and λΛ for sunlight, the path length enhancement remains a good parameter for characterizing the scattering eﬃciency of a surface structure. In the following, I will derive the absorption and the maximum path length en- hancement by a Lambertian Scatterer in a diﬀerent way compared to Yablonovitch & Cody, because the authors had focused only on the weak absorption regime. My derivation is based on the rarely cited idea of J. Gee [41], who had already proposed a very intuitive description of light-trapping in 1988. I generalize Gees concept to the problem sketched in Fig. 2.8. Fig. 2.8: Randomization of light at the scattering layer will allow us to neglect coherent eﬀects, because a ﬁxed phase relationship does not occur between diﬀusely-scattered, back-reﬂected and randomized light waves. The propagation of an averaged light ray in a lossy waveguide can then be described by the external reﬂection Rext, the internal eﬀective reﬂectances Rb and Rf and the attenuated transmission Tr with respect to the single-pass traversal Tsp. The total reﬂection Rtot into medium n1 and total transmission Ttot into medium n3 are therefore determined by the optical depth of the medium with refractive index n2, the optical losses at the cladding layers and by the angle- averaged scattering eﬃciency. Chapter 2. Light trapping in a slab 26 2.3.1 Absorption enhancement by a Lambertian backscat- terer When the Lambertian scattering layer is situated on the rear side of a slab (as in Fig. 2.8), the calculation of the photon absorption is complicated by three issues: 1. before light arrives at the scatterer, some light may already have been re- ﬂected at the surface or absorbed during the ﬁrst traversal through the slab, 2. for greater scattering angles θ, less light will fall into the escape cone, de- ﬁned by the critical angle θc of total internal reﬂection, 3. the angular intensity distribution (AID) follows Lamberts cosine law only if the slab becomes transparent. I can cover the ﬁrst issue by truncating the incident spectrum on the Lambertian texture, considering the external reﬂection air/Si and the absorption of the ﬁrst traversal through the slab, as shown in Fig. 2.8. By calculating the angle-averaged (internal) Fresnel reﬂection Rf(λ) at the front interface, assuming rotational symmetry, I can eﬀectively address the second point: Rf(λ) 1 π Z Rf(λ, θ)n  dΩ (2.7) The more light is back-scattered from the surface normal n into the diﬀerential solid angle dΩof a hemisphere, the higher the eﬀective front reﬂection will be. The normalization factor 1/π is required by energy conservation, e.g. consider the case of an angular-independent reﬂectance Rf(θ) = const. : Rf(λ) 1 π Z Rf(λ, θ)n  dΩ= Rf(λ, θ) π Z |n| |dΩ| cos θ = Rf(λ) π 2π Z 0 dϕ π/2 Z 0 cos θ  sin θ dθ = Rf(λ)  π/2 Z 0 (2 sin θ cos θ) dθ = Rf(λ)   sin2 θ π/2 0 = Rf(λ). Chapter 2. Light trapping in a slab 27 For a material with an high refractive index and small escape cone Rf(λ) 1 π Z Rf(λ, θ)n  dΩ = π/2 Z 0 Rf(λ, θ) (2 sin θ cos θ)  dθ = π/2 Z 0 Rf(λ, θ) sin(2θ)  dθ = π/2 Z θc Rf(λ, θ) | {z } = 1 sin(2θ)  dθ + θc Z 0 Rf(λ, θ) sin(2θ)  dθ = 1 (sin θc)2 + θc Z 0 Rf(λ, θ) sin(2θ)  dθ, (2.8) the last term may be negligible. For total internal reﬂection, sin θc in Eq. 2.8 can be further replaced by the ratio of the refractive indices of the interfacing materials, according to Snells refraction law Eq. 2.3 (for m = 0). The third point is easily violated in the presence of coherent eﬀects (resonances), yet it is quite reasonable to assume incoherent scattering for a perfect diﬀuser. This assumption allows me to proceed with a statistical ray optics approach, where the light-paths are completely randomized and the phase information lost. As most backscattered light rays will diﬀer in their path through the slab of thickness d, sometimes authors have used the angle-averaged path length ℓ= d  sec θ for the calculation of the randomized transmission Tr : Tr(α, θ) = eαℓ= (Tsp)sec θ , (2.9) where α stands for the wavelength-dependent absorption coeﬃcient and Tsp for the transmission of a non-randomized single pass traversal through the slab. In the literature, the exponential factor a = sec θ is also known as the Lambertion- ality factor [42]. However, when I properly take into account that the radiance of each propagating light ray is reduced by a factor of eαdsec θ Tr(αd)  π/2 Z 0 eαdsec θ sin(2θ)  dθ (2.10) Chapter 2. Light trapping in a slab 28 and set Eq. 2.9 equal to Eq. 2.10, I can express θ as a function of the absorption coeﬃcient: Tr(αd) = π/2 Z 0 eαdsec θ sin(2θ)  dθ != (Tsp)sec θ  ln Tsp ln Tr = cos θ 0 since θ 90  θ(α(λ), d) = arccos α(λ) d ln π/2 R 0 eα(λ)dsec θ sin(2θ)  dθ !. (2.11) Since the scattering angle θ indicates the average ﬂow direction of energy from the scatterer into the absorber slab as illustrated in Fig. 2.7, θ depends on the absorbers material properties and thus can not be deﬁned a priori to calculate the transmitted intensity via Eq. 2.9, i.e. Tr θ. For example, if all the incident energy were scattered into an angle θ, the angu- lar intensity distribution (AID) of the Lambertian Scatterer would be replaced by a small lobe. The statistical nature of the Lambertian model will then be misinterpreted, because a Lambertian Scatterer spreads the incident light into a full hemisphere. The graph in Fig. 2.9 now demonstrates that the average scattering angle of a Lambertian diﬀuser drops in the presence of absorption for shorter wavelengths; this drop is not due to imperfect randomization of the incident light by the scat- terer, but due to the loss of isotropy of the scattered radiation due to absorption, which equally leads to a deviation from Lamberts cosine law. In conclusion, the radiance of a Lambertian Scatterer becomes anisotropic in ab- sorbing media, such that it would be misleading to assume the average-scattering angle θ or the average path length ℓas independent of the material properties. From the point of view of scattering, a structure then should not be optimized for a thin absorber layer or for the weak absorption regime only, but for optical depths greater than 0.01 dB. Chapter 2. Light trapping in a slab 29 Fig. 2.9: The average scattering angle θ speciﬁes the average direction of the radiated energy ﬂowing into a medium with refractive index n and thickness d. The angular intensity distribution (AID) of a Lambertian diﬀuser, however, can deviate from the cosine law in presence of absorption α = 0. The radiance then looses its isotropic character, because the energy ﬂow is less attenuated for rays that are scattered into smaller angles. In subsection 1.3.1, I deﬁned the optical depth of 0.01 dB as the mediums threshold value for transparency. A Lambertian Scatterer thus will scatter Lambertianly only, when the optical depth falls below 0.01 dB, i.e. when the product of α and d is smaller than 0.003  which stands in contrast to a wavelength independent scattering angle θ(λ) or the constant Lambertionality factor a(λ) = sec θ = const. by Battaglia et el. [42]. Please note that the Yablonovitch & Cody treatment assumes a constant angle of 60, so especially for strongly absorbing media, this angle may be very diﬀerent form the eﬀective angle shown here. 2.3.1.1 The Lambertian Limit In the following I will derive the total absorption of a slab with a Lambertian Scatterer at the back or front side. Since the outlined derivation is based on the multiple reﬂections at the cladding layers, the only required quantities to know are a) the optical depth of the absorber slab and b) the refractive index contrast between the absorber and the incident or substrate medium. I will ﬁrst calculate the absorption caused by the randomization of the light-paths through the slab, i.e. Tr, and afterwards account for the multipass nature of trapped light. The Chapter 2. Light trapping in a slab 30 integral in Eq. 2.10 is evaluated with the help of the exponential integral Γ(τ) =  Z τ eu u  du, the substitution u(θ) = τ/ cos θ and two integrations by parts: Tr(τ α d) = Z π/2 0 eτ/ cos θ sin(2θ)  dθ = 2τ 2   Z τ eu u3  du = 2τ 2   eτ 2τ 2 1 2  Z τ eu u2  du   = eτ τ 2  eτ τ Γ(τ)  = eτ (1 τ) + τ 2  Γ(τ), (2.12) and does only depend on the optical depth τ = αd, which is the product of the wavelength dependent absorption coeﬃcient α and the physical thickness of the slab d. Finally, the total absorption Atot of a slab with Lambertian back-scatterer can now be calculated by adding all reﬂected and transmitted light paths together like it was illustrated in Fig. 2.8: Atot = 1 Rtot Ttot = 1  Rext +  X m=0 (1 Rext)  Tsp RbTr  (RfTr RbTr)m  (1 Rf) !   X m=0 (1 Rext)  Tsp  (RfTr RbTr)m  (1 Rb) ! = (1 Rext) (1 Rext)  Tsp 1 RbRfT 2r  [RbTr  (1 Rf) + (1 Rb)] = (1 Rext) 1 RbRfT 2r  1 RbRfT 2 r  Tsp RbTr(1 Rf) Tsp(1 Rb)  = 1 Rext 1 RbRfT 2r  [ (1 Tsp) + (1 Tr)  RbTsp + (Tsp Tr)  RbRfTr ] . (2.13) Chapter 2. Light trapping in a slab 31 Rext stands for the probability that an incident photon is reﬂected by the slab, whereas Tsp Tr is the transmitted fraction after the ﬁrst direct traversal. The prefactor (recirculation factor) takes into account the attenuation of the average light ray due to the multiple upward and downward reﬂections at the cladding layers. The specular case is reproduced for Tr = Tsp, i.e. when the single pass absorption (1Tsp) is enhanced by the product of Rb and Tsp. If the Lambertian Scatterer is designed to work in transmission, Tsp must be replaced by Tr, which maximizes the total absorption Atot. The eﬀective backreﬂection Rb is 100% only for a lossless reﬂecting surface and may otherwise be analogously deﬁned to Rf in Eq. 2.7: Rb(λ) 1 π Z Rb(λ, θ)n  dΩ. (2.14) The more light is back-scattered from the surface normal n into the diﬀerential solid angle dΩof a hemisphere, the higher the eﬀective back reﬂection Rb will be. A black substrate, for example, would reﬂect almost no incident radiation (Rb = 0) back into the absorber layer; a silver mirror is instead highly reﬂective (Rb  95%) for wavelengths above 800 nm, yet highly absorptive (Rb  90%) for wavelengths below 500 nm. Since Eq. 2.14 and Eq. 2.7 allow us to calculate Rb and Rf for arbitray substrate and incident media, respectively, Eq. 2.13 can be used to calculate the absorption enhancement by a Lambertian Scatterer on the bottom or top (with Tsp = Tr) of absorber layers. Chapter 2. Light trapping in a slab 32 2.3.2 The maximum absorption enhancement The multipass nature of the Lambertian model is highlighted by the absorption enhancement due to the randomization of the path lengths. Dividing Eq. 2.13 by the absorption of a direct traversal 1 Tsp allows to quantify the enhanced absorption: Atot 1 Tsp = 1 Rext 1 RbRf T 2r  1 Tsp 1 Tsp  +  1 Tr 1 Tsp   RbTsp + + Tsp 1 + 1 Tr 1 Tsp   RbRfTr  = 1 Rext 1 RbRf T 2r   1 +  1 Tr 1 Tsp   RbTsp +  1 Tr 1 Tsp 1   RbRfTr  = 1 Rext 1 RbRf T 2r  h 1 + η  RbTsp + (η 1)  RbRfTr i . (2.15) Since Tr Tsp (see Eq. 2.12), the enhancement factor describing randomisation alone, which can be expressed as η(τ α d) = 1 Tr 1 Tsp = 1 + τ 1 eτ  h eτ τ  Γ(τ) i , (2.16) is at best equal to 2 for weakly absorbed light (τ 0), while it is unity for strongly absorbed light (τ ), since the limit of the function τ  Γ(τ) is zero for both cases. The 4n2 absorption enhancement limit derived in ref. [39] can then simply be reproduced in ﬁrst order approximation for Rext = 0, Rb = 1 and Rf 1 1/n2, with n being the refractive index of the medium: Atot 1 Tsp  1 0 1 (1 1/n2)   1 + 2  1 + 1  (1 1/n2)  = 4n2 1. (2.17) The theoretical maximum absorption enhancement is reduced by the ﬁrst direct traversal, because the 4n2 limit corresponds to a Lambertian front-scatterer with Tr replacing Tsp in Eq. 2.13. In reference to Eq. 1.1, I see light-trapping as the ability to increase the intensity by 2 n2 and the optical depth τ = αd of a medium by two on average, at best : 2  n2  (2  τ) = 4n2  αd. (2.18) Chapter 2. Light trapping in a slab 33 Since the photon absorption is proportional to the incident photon ﬂux, i.e. to the product of the photon density n3 and the group velocity c/n, the enhancement of n2 is due to the medium eﬀect (brightness theorem). The n2 enhancement rests on the assumption of an equilibrium between the incident black-body illumination and the internal isotropic radiation ﬁeld. For a perfect mirror at the backside of the thin-ﬁlm, the enhancement factor is further increased by a factor of 2, because the incident light intensity is virtually doubled. Scattering thus aims to maximize the optical depth τ. For a Lambertian scatterer, the average path length ℓthrough a slab is exactly twice the slab thickness: 1 Tr α  ℓ= π/2 Z 0 (αd  sec θ)  sin(2θ)  dθ = α  (2d) (2.19) as long as αd  0.01 dB. Consequently, light is mostly scattered into the angle θ = 60in this weak absorptive regime, as illustrated in Fig. 2.10. Fig. 2.10: If light is scattered into the angle θ and traverses the absorber layer as it were twice as thick, the scattering angle will be θ = 60. If a scatterer is able to achieve ℓ= 2d even in presence of absorption, it would outperform the Lambertian case, whereas a scatterer with ℓ 2d will beat the 4n2 limit. Curiously, authors sometimes assume a Lambertian texture, but then consider all path lengths to be enhanced by 4n2, Amax 1 exp α  4n2 d   4n2  α d 1 + 4n2  α d for α d  0.01 dB, (2.20) which does misrepresent the physical picture. The comparison may still be ad- equate, as eﬀectively the analogy was made between a textured slab and a 4n2 times thicker unstructured absorber layer. However, Amax in Eq. 2.20 will over- estimate Atot in Eq. 2.13 for αd  0.01 dB, i.e. when the angular intensity distribution (AID) falls below Lamberts cosine law. Chapter 2. Light trapping in a slab 34 2.3.2.1 Over the limits If interference eﬀects violate the ray approximation, it becomes diﬃcult to deﬁne an optical path length. The eﬃciency of a photonic structure must then be reformulated as its ability to enhance the optical depth of a thin ﬁlm [43]. Assuming a silicon slab can be understood as an optical waveguide, Yu et al. [44] explain why the 4n2 limit remains valid over a large spectral bandwidth. The authors ﬁrst compare the available number of propagating waveguide modes in each wavelength interval with the ability of a scatterer to couple sunlight in or out of these modes. The integrated absorption thereby serves as a ﬁgure of merit in this comparison, because a strong coupling is generally seen as incompatible with a large bandwidth. The outcome of the comparison then shows that the number of available modes directly scales with the absorber thickness, whereas the correlated coupling strengths are only subject to the design of the surface structure. Therefore, the maximum integrated absorption enhancement becomes independent of the absorber thickness when compared to the single-pass absorp- tion. Secondly, the authors demonstrate how a strong spectral dependency of periodic structures allows to achieve enhancement factors above 4n2 in limited wavelength ranges. However, reducing the operating bandwidth does not maximize the inte- grated absorption, because the absorption would drop in other spectral regions. Finally, Yu et al. also highlight the eﬀect of a strong angular dependency. If Θin is the limiting angle of incidence with respect to the normal to the surface, the coupling strength is proven to scale with 1/ sin2 Θin. Absorption enhancement factors can therefore be as high as 4n2/ sin2 Θin, when the surface structure is designed to address only a selected range of incident angles. In fact, the 4n2 limit was derived on the assumption of an acceptance cone covering the full hemisphere (Θin = 90), as mentioned in Fig. 2.7. In conclusion, since eﬃcient solar cell operation requires a broad angular and spectral response to sunlight, the 4n2 absorption enhancement remains the lim- iting case for stationary solar cells. Higher enhancement factors may be possible in a limited wavelength range, but also reduce the total integrated absorption. Chapter 2. Light trapping in a slab 35 Peters [45] was recently able to derive the same conclusion than Yu et al., yet his study only based on the conditions of how light is incident onto and escapes from an isotropic absorber. Therefore, the 4n2 absorption enhancement factor is not a speciﬁc fundamental limit for diﬀractive light-trapping structures, but applies independently of the scattering mechanism. 2.4 Assessment of light-trapping Many research proposals show large absorption enhancement factors or claim to have achieved the 4n2 limit. However, the assessment of the light-trapping technique itself turns out to be diﬃcult, because proposals often diﬀer from each other either in the design or in the operating spectral and angular range. In the end, I may get guidance from simulations of which geometries or fea- tures are desirable and from measurements indicating real performances. A quantitative assessment is further complicated by the vast diversity of meth- ods used, which include anti-reﬂection and in-coupling concepts, 1D and 2D back-scatterers, embedded metal nanoparticles, photonic crystals and random or periodic diﬀractive structures on one or one both sides of the absorber layer. Since all of these methods are applied to diﬀerent materials and layer thicknesses, it seems diﬃcult to deﬁne a ﬁgure-of-merit that can purely assess the performance of a light-trapping technique  irrespective of the material, fabrication method and technology used. 2.4.1 How to assess light-trapping structures for solar cells ? Light-trapping is commonly assessed by the absorption enhancement compared to a ﬂat silicon slab, so a common ﬁgure-of-merit is the ratio of the absorption Amax of a structured slab to the absorption Aref of an unstructured reference slab: F  R Amax(λ)  dλ R Aref(λ)  dλ . (2.21) Chapter 2. Light trapping in a slab 36 Since the enhancement factor F is maximal in the weak-absorption regime, i.e. when the optical depth is in the order of some centi-dBs, many studies cited en- hancements factor only for this regime. However, light-trapping for photovoltaic applications aims to increase the absorption over the full wavelength range of the solar spectrum, i.e. from 300 nm up to the wavelength bandgap λmax of the absorber material, so such high enhancement factors have little practical utility. Instead, the quantity directly related to the integrated total absorption is the generated electrical current of a solar cell. If there was no voltage drop, the short-circuit current Jsc would be the largest current which may be drawn from a solar cell. Therefore, light-trapping might be assessed in terms of the Jsc en- hancement compared to a non-structured reference: F   Jmax Jref = λmax R 300 nm Amax(λ) Φ(λ)  dλ λmax R 300 nm Aref(λ) Φ(λ)  dλ . (2.22) Here, Φ is the photon ﬂux of the standard reference spectrum AM1.5G, which is the solar spectrum most articles refer to. However, the ﬁgure-of-merit F would not distinguish between the causes of the current enhancement, because a higher enhancement factor F could be achieved by a diﬀerent anti-reﬂection coating or by a diﬀerence in absorber material qual- ity. In order to eliminate the material quality dependence, proposals have been benchmarked against the material dependent Lambertian enhancement factor JLL/Jref : G  F  JLL/Jref = Jmax JLL , (2.23) which expresses the performance of the proposed structure Jmax against the theoretical achievement JLL of a Lambertian texture. Therefore, the G factor quantiﬁes the electrical current in percentages of an ideal Lambertian texture. Chapter 2. Light trapping in a slab 37 For a few common photovoltaic materials, Bozzola et al. [43] reported the ideal short-circuit current Jref achieved with an unstructured slab against the theo- retical maximum short-circuit current JLL achieved by a Lambertian texture as a function of the absorber thickness (exemplary shown in Fig. 2.11 for silicon). Their study graphically illustrates not only how the G factor depends on the absorber thickness, but also why the G factor rather impedes the assessment of light-trapping. For example, even a non-structured solar cell yields a G  0 or can approach G = 1, because the current generated by only a double pass traversal of light can be as high as 40 mA/cm2 in a 100 µm thick silicon absorber layer, i.e. G = 40/45 0.9 according to Fig. 2.11. Basch et al. [46] were the ﬁrst to propose a thickness and material independent ﬁgure-of-merit that tried to isolate the light-trapping eﬀect as much as possible. They suggested to compare the current gain by a proposed texture Jmax Jref against the theoretical gain by a Lambertian texture JLL Jref : G  Jmax Jref JLL Jref = G  JLL Jref JLL Jref (2.24) If subtracting the current Jref of a non-structured solar cell from the current Jmax of a structured solar cell removes the contribution provided by anti-reﬂection, G would only quantify the beneﬁts of the light-trapping technique. However, the theoretical model of a Lambertian texture assumes a scattering layer of zero thickness. The anti-reﬂection eﬀect of a Lambertian texture can thus take any arbitrary value. While ideal anti-reﬂection properties are gener- ally assumed for the calculation of JLL, practically, anti-reﬂection coatings will hardly cover the full solar spectrum. Therefore, if the denominator in Eq. 2.24 underestimates the anti-reﬂection properties of the reference cell, the Gfactor will always remain smaller than 1. In order to achieve a G= 1, the proposed structure will need to either provide additional anti-reﬂection action apart from Lambertian light-trapping or it needs to outperform the performance of a Lam- bertian texture  the meaning of Gthen remains ambiguous. Pratesi et al. [47] deﬁned a similar Gfactor, but only suggested to replace JLL in the denominator of Eq. 2.24 with the total incident photon-ﬂux of the sun Chapter 2. Light trapping in a slab 38 Jsun (expressed as an electrical current). This substitution would therefore not change any conclusions of the previous discussion regarding the format of the ﬁgure-of-merit, as the denominator will still not properly take the anti-reﬂection properties into account. In fact, the proposed ﬁgure-of-merit rather highlights the impossibility to achieve a G= 1, because the current Jmax of a structured solar cell would now need to absorb all incident photons from sun, whereas semi- conductors are transparent to photons whose energies lie below their bandgap. Fig. 2.11: In contemporary solar cell research, the ﬁgure of merit is often identiﬁed with the improvement in the short-circuit current. In the ﬁgure above, the short-circuit current density Jsc for crystalline silicon is expressed as a function of the absorber layer thickness (assuming the AM1.5 global solar spectrum). The JMB and Jmin graphs correspond to currents generated by a double pass traversal of light in the absorber layer with (blue solid) and without (black dotted) perfect anti-reﬂection coating, respectively. The JLL refers to devices textured with an ideal Lambertian scatterer and perfect anti-reﬂection coating (red-dashed line). All devices have a perfect mirror on the back. Please note that the red and the blue curves will converge for thicknesses greater than 104 µm due to the indirect nature of silicons bandgap. For example, while the global solar irradiance is still more than 25% of its peak value at 1280 nm wavelength, a 1,000 µm thick silicon absorber does only absorb 20% of it by a double pass traversal of light, whereas a ten times thicker layer can already absorb 90% of it. Chapter 2. Light trapping in a slab 39 2.4.2 The light-trapping-eﬃciency (LTE) I proposed to replace Jref in the denominator of Eq. 2.24 by the short-circuit current JMB of an ideal reference device. LTE  Jmax Jref JLL JMB . (2.25) Since JLL and JMB assume perfect anti-reﬂection at the illuminated surface on the front and perfect reﬂection at an ideal metal mirror on the back of the ab- sorber layer, the current gain JLL JMB purely reﬂects the light-trapping capa- bility of a Lambertian texture. Therefore, the LTE separates the anti-reﬂection action from light-trapping, because it compares the real gain by structuring (nom- inator) to the hypothetical gain of ideal devices (denominator). The format also follows the eﬃciency ηc of a Carnot heat-engine, which compares the amount of entropy-free energy delivered to a load (nominator) against the ideal case (denominator) with the removal of all thermal energy Q : ηc = Qmax Qref Qmax 0 . (2.26) In order to maximize the eﬃciency of a Carnot-engine, the heat sink Qref in Eq. 2.26 would need to suspend all thermal motions and interactions. Corre- spondingly, in order to take advantage of light-trapping, Jref would need to be as close as possible to JMB in Eq. 2.25. Starting from a good reference device is thus as important as making a good light-trapping structure; otherwise, using a diﬀerent anti-reﬂection coating layer could become more beneﬁcial than light- trapping. The format of the LTE, however, seems to allow a higher ﬁgure-of-merit with the degree of worsening the reference device Jref. Viewed optically, Jref will always consist of a coating layer, which could just be the encapsulation layer for protect- ing the solar cell from moisture, in addition to a back-reﬂector for enhancing the photon ﬂux in the absorber medium. It is true, that both techniques, in reality, do not work over a broad bandwidth without any optical losses; anti-reﬂection Chapter 2. Light trapping in a slab 40 coatings are not 100% transmissive as mirrors are not 100% reﬂective for all pho- tonts. Therefore, once the optimized coating and back-reﬂector were applied, the same coating and mirror must also be applied to the structured solar cell device. Any reduction of Jref would then likewise aﬀect Jmax, such that Jmax Jref purely highlights the beneﬁt of the structuring approach. Secondly, since the material properties of Jref also determine JMB and JLL, the LTE remains independent of the material properties and only assesses the light- trapping capability Jmax. A LTE = 1 then means, that a structure achieved the same current gain as a Lambertian scatterer  irrespective of the method or technique used. 2.4.2.1 The eﬀective thickness The absorption in Eq. 2.13 was deﬁned as a function of the total absorber layer thickness, assuming the Lambertian scatterer to be of vanishing thickness. There- fore, all calculated short-circuit currents shown in Fig. 2.11 refer to the total thickness ttot of the silicon slab. Since the absorption enhancement is also thickness dependent, I need to consider what thickness value to use for a structured material. Should I use the maxi- mum thickness, i.e. the thickness between the bottom of the ﬁlm and the peaks of the structure, or should I use some eﬀective thickness teff that represents the equivalent volume of material ? The eﬀective-thickness teff, which is the average thickness of the material, is often seen as a ﬁgure-of-merit for the greatest possible absorption achieved with the least volume of material. The most promising literature proposals might then be those with the smallest eﬀective-thickness teff. However, the eﬀective-material-thickness teff should not be confused with the eﬀective-optical-thickness ℓdeﬁned by Eq. 2.9, which is the angle-averaged path length through the absorber; it is teff ℓ2 ttot (see Eq. 2.19). The LTE in Eq. 2.25 is deﬁned for the total thickness ttot of the absorber that includes the scattering layer, as was shown in Fig. 2.12. Therefore, the LTE does not take the material consumption into account. Chapter 2. Light trapping in a slab 41 The eﬀective material thickness seems to be a useful concept for comparing light trapping structures in terms of their material budget, but the performance of a scatterer depends not only on the volume of the absorber material VSi or on the geometry of the structure. The volume of material in between the structures Vcm plays an equally important role, as it determines the refractive index contrast and thus the scattering eﬃciency. Since teff always neglects the volume contribution of the complementary material Vcm, it consequently lowers the Lambertian limit of absorption: teff  VSi A  VSi + Vcm A ttot, (2.27) where A stands for the illuminated surface area of the active absorber. To il- lustrate, if I was to construct an absorber layer of 1 µm thickness with narrow pillars of 4 µm height, the eﬀective thickness might only be teff = 1.2 µm, which makes for a very favourable comparison. Instead, I believe that one should use ttot = 5 µm, as the scattering layer adds 4 µm to the absorber layer of 1 µm. Ultimately, very narrow and high aspect-ratio structures, such as the long nano- wires in Fig. 2.2a, mainly aim to maximize the surface-to-volume ratio. The higher the aspect-ratio, the larger the surface area and the more often a photon will interact with the structure, even though it may already entered and left the absorber material before  hence the higher its absorption probability for the same eﬀective thickness teff. The LTE, however, does not assess the interaction rate with the structure, but aims to assess the longer dwell time a photon spends in the absorber material due to a light-trapping structure, correctly addressed by the total absorber thickness ttot. Chapter 2. Light trapping in a slab 42 2.5 State of the art Before I will apply the LTE of Eq. 2.25 to literature proposals, a few impor- tant milestones that paved the way for thin-ﬁlm silicon solar cell technology are reviewed. The survey in subsection 2.5.1 covers the important milestones that guided the advancement in our technical understanding. The current state-of- the-art is summarized in subsection 2.5.2. Finally, as I was indeed able to identify a few structures very close to a light-trapping eﬃciency equal to LTE = 1, I will analyze their common aspects in section 2.6. 2.5.1 Important milestones Even if the genesis of photovoltaics can be traced back to the observations by E. Becquerel in 1839, progress in photovoltaics has been slow and has proceeded in approximately half-century steps. The discretization of light in 1900 by M. Planck is often referred to as the foun- dation of quantum theory. The theory was not only able to explain why a metal plate can eject electrons under the action even very low intensity light (photo- electric eﬀect), but also provided the framework for the realisation of the ﬁrst silicon solar cell in 1946 by Ohl [48] and the point-contact transistor in 1947 by Shockley et al. [49]. In fact, the pioneering work by W. Shockley marked the invention of the pn- junction diode and the ﬁrst practical silicon solar cell shortly after. Although Fig. 2.12: The performance of a scatterer relies on the refractive index con- trast and thus on the materials between the structures. Therefore, the LTE is deﬁned for the total thickness ttot of the absorber material that includes the scattering layer. Chapter 2. Light trapping in a slab 43 the device was a milestone in the history of photovoltaics with a 6 % power con- version eﬃciency, this success is only humbly reported in a very short letter by Chapin et al. in 1954 [50]. The reason may have been that Texas Instruments was already in the leverage position to manufacture silicon pn-junctions in vol- ume [51], owing to G. Teals technical achievement of silicon puriﬁcation and crystal growth [52]. By the end of the 50s, silicon thus began to replace the industrys preferred semiconductor material, germanium, yet it took another half-century for a sili- con photovoltaic industry to emerge. The oil crisis of the 70s kick-started interest in solar power for terrestrial use. Competing with a large solar program in the USA, M. A. Green started the solar laboratory at the University of New South Wales in 1974. His research team soon became internationally recognized as one of the elite in the ﬁeld; the group frequently set new world-record eﬃciencies by improved electrical and optical designs. For example, the ﬁrst 20% eﬃcient cell was fabricated by the group in 1985 [53] and was textured with a 1D periodic slanted surface as apparent from Fig. 2.13, allowing both improved light-in coupling at oblique angles and a reduced electrical transport resistance. The beneﬁt of such anti-reﬂective v-shape textures were realized in the mid 70s [54] and also assisted in the demonstration of 14-17% eﬃcient but 400 µm thick silicon solar cells in 1977 [55]. I would describe the mid 80s as the foundation period for light-trapping in thin- ﬁlm solar cells, when E. Yablonovitch and G. Cody highlighted the importance of random textures as a means to trap the light in the absorber slab [39]. The authors also explained how light-trapping allows to increase the optical absorp- tion of a semiconductor by 4n2, if n is the index of refraction. Shortly thereafter, Sheng et al. [56] demonstrated that periodic textures can even exceed this limit in the weak absorption region, as discussed in subsubsection 2.3.2.1. Chapter 2. Light trapping in a slab 44 Fig. 2.13: The ﬁrst 20% eﬃcient silicon solar cells present microgrooved surfaces [53]. The slats of 5 µm depth on a 10 µm pitch not only retain the refractive and anti-reﬂective advantages of pyramidally textured surfaces, but also avoid electrical transport resistances for lateral current ﬂow to the collect- ing ﬁngers. The ﬁnger metallization of the cell is further restricted to regions which have not been grooved. Deckman et al. [57] were the ﬁrst who experimentally demonstrated absorption enhancement factors of up to 12. The same authors also showed that the achieve- ments were directly translated into 25% higher short-circuit currents [58], though extremely thick a-Si:H absorber layers around 1 µm were used in both studies. P. Campbell and M. A. Green then tried to determine the optical performance of pyramidal textures with respect to anti-reﬂection and light-trapping action [59]. The authors found the textures to yield high anti-reﬂection and refractive light- trapping, when the square based pyramids were at the front and a ﬂat mirror at the back. The team later used such a texture to achieve a 24% eﬃcient silicon solar cell with 280 µm thickness [60]. The authors also recognized that the 4n2 limit would only be achieved if the previously mentioned 1D slanted surface texture in Fig. 2.13 was kept at the front and the same pattern applied to the rear side of the absorber, yet perpendicularly aligned with respect to the top one. For a silicon solar cell of about 100 µm thickness, such an arrangement would outperform pyramidal structures on both sides by 4% relative advantage in current generating according to their analysis [59]. At the end of the 80s, E. Yablonovitch provided further more background infor- mation and insights into the properties of a radiation ﬁeld in a semiconductor Chapter 2. Light trapping in a slab 45 [61]. Yablonovitch particularly focused on the consequences of artiﬁcially modi- fying the semiconductor with periodic structures. His paper about the inhibited spontaneous emission in solid-state physics and electronics is now recognized as one of the most important contributions to the ﬁeld of photonics with more than 10,000 citations. Contrary to intuition, he described light-trapping as the equivalence of restricting the spontaneous emission  which is the reversible process of photon absorption  into only those waveguide modes that are able to outcouple light from the material slab. The eﬃcient operation of a solar cell does indeed require the re- emission of most absorbed photons back to the sun, because the electrical voltage increases with the re-emission rate. However, while the internal emission would be lost, the externally incident radiation becomes internally trapped, permit- ting the semiconductor slab to be correspondingly thinner  at the same degree of absorption. Yablonovitch thus interprets light-trapping and the reduction of semiconductor volume as a consequence of restricting the spontaneous emission into only the essential waveguide modes. The 90s are then characterized by the expanding market of silicon solar cells. Germany and Japan are today seen as case studies for a government-driven PV market, because the two governments had initiated subsidy programs in order to spur adoption, e.g. they were the ﬁrst to introduce feed-in tariﬀs (1990). From the scientiﬁc perspective, the major focus was the development of new, large-scale and low-cost manufacturing techniques [62]. Chou et al. intro- duced the imprint lithography technique with 25 nm resolution [63], for example, whereas Gombert et al. [64] demonstrated moth-eye structures that were fabri- cateable on a large-scale. Two long-lasting record cells were also made at this time. The ﬁrst record was made by the Japanese company Kaneka [65]. They realized a device utilizing a natural surface texture for the absorption enhancement of a 2 µm thick polycrystalline silicon layer by a rough back reﬂector (STAR). The STAR-cell was not only 100 times thinner than the ﬁrst practical silicon solar cell had been [50], the 10.7% eﬃciency was also almost twice as high as the original device and demonstrated that thin crystalline cells can achieve suﬃcient photon absorption by minute textured structures. The 90s may then also referred to as Chapter 2. Light trapping in a slab 46 the decade of preparation for thin-ﬁlm PV technology. The second outstanding solar cell device was the PERL cell made by Zhao et al. [66] of Martin Greens group at UNSW, who were able to improve their former result by 2% through reduced surface recombination losses. The use of a thin, thermally grown SiO2 layer of about 20 nm thickness was found to eﬀectively passivate the surface defects and allowed to establish the new performance level of 24.4% eﬃciency in 1998. The device remained one of the top terrestrial silicon solar cells until 2013 [67]. Since the researchers were motivated by the fact that one third of the commercial PV products were based on large-grained multicrys- talline silicon wafers (due to the lower costs), in the same mentioned study, the authors also showed a 6% improvement in the eﬃciency of multicrystalline solar cells. Chapter 2. Light trapping in a slab 47 For multicrystalline silicon, anisotropic alkaline etching results in pyramids with completely random facets due to the uneven etch rates of the crystal planes [68]. The reﬂectance then becomes similar to an untextured surface according to J. Hylton [69]. The preferred texturing method for multicrystalline cells is therefore a wet isotropic acidic etching process [70]. Based on these observations, Zhao et al. [66] was able to texture the surface of a 260 µm thick multicrystalline wafer from Eurosolare with the honeycomb structure shown in Fig. 2.14, which enabled to obtain a 19.8% power conversion eﬃciency. The authors showed that the refractive light-trapping properties of the hexagonal pattern were comparably eﬀective to the inverted-pyramids used in monocrystalline silicon solar cells, but less eﬃcient in terms of their anti- reﬂection action. At the same time as M. A. Green published the intrinsic material function for crystalline silicon [11], Moharam [71], Whittaker [72] and co-authors outlined how the performance of light-trapping structures can be accurately simulated. These three papers provided the important groundwork for the emerging theoretical modelling period of diﬀractive light-trapping structures. Fig. 2.14: (a) Schematic of a honeycomb surface texture for light-trapping. The texture could increase the optical path length of weakly absorbed light at 1060 nm wavelength by factors as high as 40 compared to a planar reference cell according to the authors [66]. However, such high enhancement factors are clearly not possible, because of the increased absorption in the rear metal reﬂector due to multiple light passes across the cell, which I will study later (section 4.3) as one of the key issues of metals. (b) The SEM images show the perspective view (left) and a plan view (right) of a fabricated honeycomb surface structure on a large-grained polycrystalline silicon wafer. The spacing of the hexagons is 14 µm. Since the texture resembles a reversed moth-eye pattern, the background picture was inserted to highlight this similarity. The protuberances inside the combs  not present in the honeycomb texture  are responsible for the excellent anti-reﬂection properties. Chapter 2. Light trapping in a slab 48 I see Shahs article in Science [73] both as the end of the long childhood of photovoltaics and as the begin of a thin-ﬁlm silicon solar cell technology, be- cause his review about the recent developments of photovoltaic solar modules concludes with the suggestion that thin-ﬁlm crystalline silicon is becoming the prime candidate for future photovoltaics. After the turn of the millenium, photovoltaics became a popular research subject, which is reﬂected by the number of publications in Fig. 2.15 and by the citation history of the paper from W. Shockley and H. J. Queisser [13]. According to W. Marx [14], the analysis by Shockley and Queisser has remained unnoticed for about 50 years, before the study literally attracted attention: the paper occupies the citation-rank number 12 of all 11,723 physics papers entered in the Web of Science in 1961, and it attracted half of all citations from solar cell or photovoltaic papers for a 1961 paper [14]. Fig. 2.15: Bibliographic analysis of publications (left) and citations (right) entered in the Web of Science (Thomson Reuters) before the 21st of Novem- ber 2014. I used the keywords light, trapping and solar and restricted the research areas to physics and optics. The total number of all publications is 2,000, whereas the number of all cited references is 38,000 in total. The exponential increase of research interest runs parallel with the steep increase of the cumulative PV capacity (not shown here). The silicon shortage be- tween 2005 and 2008 could even have stimulated and intensiﬁed the scientiﬁc interest for light-trapping. For example, in 2005 a new article was published almost every week, while it ran up to one paper per day in 2012. Today, novel concepts, new strategies and emerging technologies in the PV ﬁeld  like building-integrated, organic, dye-sensitized, plasmonic, CZTS, multi-junction, perovskite, HIT, ﬂexible, hot-carrier, photon conversion, graphene, pentacene, quantum-dot or nanowire solar cells  make it easy to lose perspective. Chapter 2. Light trapping in a slab 49 2.5.2 The state of the art Light-trapping by random scattering (see Fig. 2.16) has since become the indus- trial standard for thin-ﬁlm silicon modules [74]. At the same time, many novel methods for creating light scattering were introduced. Metallic, dielectric 1D, 2D or 3D textures and photonic crystals were widely studied for their suitability for solar cells. The design optimization generally concentrated on the optical properties at the front (light in-coupling) or at the rear side (oﬀ-specular reﬂectance) of the thin-ﬁlm absorber material. Structur- ing the back side normally addresses the red part of the spectrum only, since the blue and the green part of the visible spectrum are absorbed within the ﬁrst few hundreds of nanometers in silicon. Therefore, patterning the absorber layer from both-sides increases the degrees of freedom available to the designer, as anti-reﬂective (front side) and diﬀractive functions (back side) can be combined [7577]. Fig. 2.16: Random surface textures increase the proportion of oblique scat- tered light into the absorber. Geometric light-trapping structures can easily be obtained in monocrystalline [78] (top left) or multicrystalline silicon [79] (top right) by chemical wet etching. Submicron light-trapping structures can form during the deposition, e.g. Asahi-U (bottom left), or may be chemically etched, e.g. into ZnO (bottom right) [80]. Chapter 2. Light trapping in a slab 50 However, the advantages of using the strong scattering ability of metallic back reﬂectors are compromised by the substantial absorption losses in the metal it- self. In the weak absorption limit, i.e. when light trapping is most beneﬁcial, the light will interact even more often, so light-trapping, in fact, enhances parasitic absorption eﬀects further. Campa et al. [81], for example, have found an overall reduction in the total reﬂectance of up to 40% in comparison to a specular silver reﬂector. Such optical losses may, in principle, be minimized when the metal is separated from the silicon by a transparent oxide layer [82], as obliquely incident light will likely be totally internally reﬂected at a silicon/dielectric interface. Conduct- ing oxide spacer layers between the metal and silicon absorber material indeed became a standard in state-of-the-art light-trapping designs. Thin conductive oxides thus can play a signiﬁcant role not only as transparent front electrode, but also in improving the back reﬂection properties [83]. Alternatively, the metal mirror at the back can be replaced with a distributed Bragg reﬂector [84, 85]. In order to identify the most promising light-trapping strategies, I applied the LTE deﬁned in Eq. 2.25 to numerous structures found in the literature. While the majority of proposals are numerical simulations based on (intrinsic) c-Si, experimental studies are often conducted on hydrogenated microcrystalline silicon (µ-Si:H) layers. Although the absorption coeﬃcient of µ-Si:H depends on the defect density, crystalline/amorphous fraction and material morphology [86], its optical characteristic bears more similarity to c-Si than to a-Si:H. The LTEs of experimental structures for µ-Si:H absorber layers were thus qualitatively as- sessed with the optical constants of c-Si. When the experimental reference was not provided for the total thickness, I de- cided to use the ideal short-circuit current as the unstructured reference in order to establish a minimum for the light trapping performance. Unfortunately, designs based on amorphous silicon were excluded from the anal- ysis, because of the large variations found in the optical material properties: the material absorption of hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) strongly de- pends on the hydrogen concentration and on deposition-conditions, and these were often not provided. For example, the optical band gap of a-Si:H substan- tially varies between 1.4 eV [87] and 2 eV [88]. Therefore, the literature analysis was applied to crystalline silicon (c-Si) where well-known optical properties are available [11]. Chapter 2. Light trapping in a slab 51 Fig. 2.17: The calculated light trapping eﬃciency (LTE) of light trapping structures realized or proposed in c-Si found in the literature (see Eq. 2.25). All µc-Si:H data points were assessed with the optical constants of c-Si [11]. While the LTE is, in principle, independent of the absorber thickness, the highest performing structures operate in the 15 µm range, which may relate to the fact that the beneﬁt of light trapping is maximal in this thickness range. Notably, the solar cells with the highest eﬃciency (e.g. the 370 µm thick PERL cell) are not necessarily the best light trapping structures, highlighting the diﬀerence between the LTE and the absolute eﬃciency. This diﬀerence also highlights the importance of anti-reﬂection coatings, as already shown in Fig. 2.11. Figure 2.17 summarizes the outcome of the assessed structures, while the cor- responding short-circuit currents are listed in Tab. 2.1 to Tab. 2.3. For the assessment of the structures found in the literature, I applied the following four methods. 1. Absorption spectra. When only the numerical absorption spectra were shown [85], I used the free software tool Plot Digitizer from sourceforge.net and the standard global solar spectrum AM1.5G [89] in order to calculate the LTE of the structure. 2. Optical constants. As theoretical studies mainly use the optical constants provided by Green [11] or Palik [90], I tried to take this into account for the LTE. However, if Jref appeared too close to the current of a single-pass traversal, I recalculated the reference with the same optical constants, e.g [91]. Chapter 2. Light trapping in a slab 52 3. Eﬀective thickness. When authors compared their proposal to reference samples with the eﬀective thickness, e.g [59], I recalculated the short-circuit currents JMB and JLL, since in Eq. 2.25 all currents are deﬁned for the same (total) absorber thickness. For the planar reference Jref, I decided to use the ideal short-circuit current JMB in order to establish a minimum for the light trapping performance. 4. Parasitic absorption. When authors compute the electrical current from absorption spectra, the charge-collection is generally assumed to be 100%, i.e. every photogenerated charge-carrier contributes to the short-circuit current. Since the total absorption is decomposed into useful absorption in the silicon and parasitic absorption in other layers, the electrical current must refer to the sole active absorption only. I therefore excluded studies where I suspected parasitic inﬂuences. My criterion was a too high absorp- tion near the wavelength bandgap of silicon. For a 300 µm thick silicon wafer, the absorption at 1100 nm wavelength will be greater than 7% without back reﬂector and anti-reﬂection coating. For a 1 µm thin silicon slab with 100% anti-reﬂection coating and lossless mirror, it requires a path length enhancement factor of 4n2 to absorb almost 2% of the incident light, if n = 3.54 refers to the refractive index at 1100 nm wavelength. However, if the metal mirror were 99% reﬂective, the para- sitic loss may already sample to 1 0.99(2n2)  20%, assuming the light is trapped by total internal reﬂection at the front and the metal mirror at the back. The review allows me to conclude that light trapping is now close to being a solved problem, because several studies were able to achieve an LTE very close to the ideal 100% performance. Naturally, demonstrating such high light-trapping eﬃ- ciencies in real working solar cells still remains a challenging task. As the key function of light-trapping structures is to enhance the absorption eﬃciency of a solar cell, it remains imperative to minimize the inﬂuence of the optical design on other process mechanisms that are involved in the conversion of the absorbed solar energy into electricity. So far, I could identify only one exper- imental structure approaching a LTE 80%, where nanotextures at the front Chapter 2. Light trapping in a slab 53 and random pyramids at the back were designed in respect to high performance in anti-reﬂection and in light-trapping, respectively. The design also uses a silver mirror as back reﬂector, after a 100 nm SiO2 was thermally grown on both sides of the structured 20 µm thick silicon absorber [83].

Chapter 2. Light trapping in a slab 55 At ﬁrst, the authors classify the waveguide modes into categories according to their symmetry properties under mirror reﬂection. Afterwards, they show that the mirror symmetries need to be broken to improve absorption, because the presence of mirror planes in a unit cell results in certain modes not coupling to incident light. The authors conclude that the symmetries can be broken either by destroying the periodic arrangements of the unit cell or by distorting the shape of the objects within the unit cell. They then argue that all modes will couple to light if the optical phase of any mode is not symmetric under mirror reﬂection. Following the outlined strategy, the authors indeed achieve an LTE = 0.92 for 600 nm high skewed pyramids on a 2 µm thick c-Si absorber layer. Please note, that their method diﬀers from breaking the symmetry of macroscopic structures where phase information is absent. The conclusion, that a lack of structural symmetry improves the optical absorp- tion, is also in agreement with results reported by other groups and for other geometries: 1. Peters et al. [112] compare and verify the similar light trapping properties of optimized periodic and stochastic structures having similar geometrical features. The choice of their texture was based on a particular pattern that had already been used to fabricate eﬃcient thin-ﬁlm silicon solar cells. 2. By the subtle superposition of multiple binary gratings, Martins and co- workers [92, 113] choose to tune the appropriate level of disorder into the unit cell via its Fourier spectrum. Their concept allowed the designers to obtain an LTE = 0.93 with a 190 nm etched QR code-like pattern on a 1 µm thick c-Si absorber. The design uses a 100% reﬂective mirror on the back and a 70 nm nitride coating on the top to reduce avoidable reﬂection losses. 3. Ferry et al. [114] systematically study the relationship between photocur- rent and the spatial correlations of random or designed surfaces. They evaluate four general classes of nanopatterns in terms of their Fourier trans- forms, which were obtained from AFM images, and used this as a basis for the calculation of the corresponding power spectral densities. The authors highlight that the essential design rule for strong photocurrent enhance- ments rests on the capability of tailoring the spatial frequencies in the structure to high scattering powers in the required range of optical fre- quencies. Chapter 2. Light trapping in a slab 56 Engineering light-trapping structures in terms of their impact on the optical phase thus can be understood as a general principle for enhancing the absorp- tion of thin-ﬁlms. Accordingly, whether a structure has a periodic or random morphology then tends to be less important than its local geometrical features, like the size and shape of the objects. 2.6.2 Dual structuring The beneﬁt of structuring the absorber layer from both sides increases the de- grees of freedom available to the designer, as diﬀerent functions can be combined. For example, Wang et al. [76] suggested to optimize the front and back surface of a silicon slab for anti-reﬂection and light-trapping, respectively, due to the sig- niﬁcant diﬀerence in the structural requirements. Their proposed dual-grating design uses circular nanocones as the basic building elements for the grating ge- ometry on both the front and the back surfaces. However, its realization could turn out to be complicated by the detached back reﬂector conﬁguration. Structuring the absorber layer from both sides has often been proposed by many various authors [7577, 115119]. In fact, some of the best light-trapping struc- tures listed in Tab. 2.1 to Tab. 2.3 actually adhere to this idea. 2.6.3 Electrical performance If an optically very good structure is electrically detrimental, or vice versa, the power conversion eﬃciency of a solar cell will be severely reduced. 1. From cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images Li et al. [120] show that the inability of conformal coverage tends to create pinholes in the cell, which are responsible for the electrical shunts. Using a textured substrate with a too high surface roughness for the deposition of the absorber material thus can result in short-circuiting of the entire device. Chapter 2. Light trapping in a slab 57 2. Sai et al. [108] are able to correlate the origin of carrier collection losses to the non-uniform coverage around concaves on the substrate surface. From SEM and TEM images they conclude that the period of a honeycomb lattice sets a threshold value for the maximum absorber thickness, which can be deposited onto the light-trapping structure free of cracks. Using a textured substrate with periodic structures and a too small period thus can result in electrical defects. 3. Texturing the silicon surface after the material deposition generally tends to increase the surface recombination velocity of charge carriers. However, Oh et al. [17] also measure higher Auger recombination rates in case the doping proﬁle of the device was changed by the presence of the texture. Auger recombination is understood as the recombination of an electron- hole pair that is giving up its energy to an electron in the conduction band (instead to a photon). Since the extra kinetic energy of the Auger electron is given oﬀto the silicon lattice, such lattice vibrations will likely increase the absorber temperature. Consequently, Auger recombinations are understood as heat loss, because solar energy is not converted into electricity. Recently, Isabella et al. [75] tried to optimize the optical characteristics of a com- plete solar cell stack conﬁguration by minimizing not only the parasitic absorp- tion losses, but also the electrical losses. Their proposed light-trapping scheme uses a high aspect ratio texture at the front side for anti-reﬂective purposes and low aspect ratio random pyramids at the back side for eﬃcient long-wavelength light scattering. The proposed design could theoretically (LTE = 0.96 [75]) and experimentally (LTE = 0.77 [83]) achieve the best light trapping eﬃciency. Chapter 3 Fabrication and characterisation of diﬀractive nanostructures 3.1 Introduction This chapter focuses on the methodological aspects, outlining the realization and characterization of my samples. Section 3.2 describes the nanolithography tech- niques, such as electron beam and nano-imprint lithography, used for generation of the pattern. The details of the etching process are then given in section 3.3. In section 3.4, I analyze the required characteristics of the absorption measurement setup in terms of sensitivity, accuracy and overall performance. 3.2 Nanolithography techniques Diﬀractive light trapping structures have dimensions on the order of the wave- length of light; such structures require the control aﬀorded by lithographic tech- niques. In contrast, wet etching techniques that can generate rough surface textures are cheaper and easier to implement, but they do not aﬀord this con- trol. 58 Chapter 3. Fabrication and characterisation 59 I mainly used electron beam lithography (EBL), because of its ﬂexibility. Since the long exposure times and set-up procedures required for EBL are clearly not acceptable for larger scale production of solar cells, I also developed nanoim- print lithography as a low-cost, high-performance alternative (see appendix sec- tion A). 3.2.1 Electron beam lithography Electron beam lithography (EBL) uses a beam of focussed electrons to create patterns in a resist material. As the kinetic energy of the electrons is in the keV range, the electrons de-Broglie wavelength is in the picometre range. The result- ing spotsize is only of order 1 nm, however, as it is diﬃcult to focus an electron beam with a high numerical aperture, so relatively small numerical apertures are used. The resist layer changes its solubility following electron exposure and the material becomes selectively removable in a subsequent development step. Typical feature sizes are no smaller than 10-20 nm, however, as the incoming electron beam is scattered in the resist layer; more importantly, most of the elec- trons pass through the resist layer, and only lead to exposure once they have been backscattered from the substrate, as illustrated in Fig. 3.1a. While e-beam lithography is very versatile and oﬀers a fast turnaround time from design to pattern, it is a serial process that exposes one pixel after the other, hence is relatively slow. The handicap of this pixel by pixel exposure may be illustrated best in a comparison to standard photolithography: Electron beam resist has a typical exposure dose of 150 µC/cm2, or ten electrons per surface atom (10 e/nm2). If the current is around 10 nA, the exposure of a 2 cm2 surface grating would last 1/2 day. In contrast, the clearing dose of 150 mJ/cm2 required by S1818 photoresist is achieved in 5 seconds by a UV-LED array of 30 mW optical power. Photolithography, in this particular example, is thus a factor of 104 times faster than e-beam lithography. Chapter 3. Fabrication and characterisation 60 Fig. 3.1: From left to right: electrons are accelerated towards the specimen and expose the resist. The majority of the electrons do not stop in the resist but penetrate into the substrate. (a) Even if the beam diameter can be sub- nanometer in size at the focal point, the electrons may get scattered by the resist layer and get backscattered from the substrate, which eﬀectively causes a widening of the exposure region. (b) Since the high-energetic electrons are able to break the molecular bounds, the exposed regions of a positive-tone resist become soluble in a developer. (c) After the developing step, the resist ﬁlm is used as a mask to transfer the pattern into the substrate material by etching. 3.2.1.1 The fabrication of diﬀractive structures Almost all my diﬀractive structures are realized on a silicon slab, using the positive-tone electron beam resist SX AR-P 6200 (CSAR62) from Allresist. At ﬁrst, a 250 nm thick layer of CSAR62 is spin-coated onto the cleaned and dried substrate at a rotation speed of 3000rpm for 60 sec, before the sample is left on a hotplate at 150 C for 3 min. The soft baking step removes any solvents and increases its adhesion to the substrate. The specimen is then immediately loaded into the vacuum chamber of the e-beam system (RAITH Voyager). Once the working distance, focus, stigmation and beam distortion are adjusted, the structure is passed on to the pattern generator as a GDSII design, where it will ﬁnally be broken into a grid of exposure points. Since the Voyager is able to resolve geometrical objects with 18-bit precision, the smallest logi- cally addressable element of a 500 µm exposure ﬁeld (or write-ﬁeld) measures xmin = 500 µm/218 = 2 nm sidelength. In order to keep the exposure time on an aﬀordable timescale, I typically use a pitch size of 4 or 8 nm without losses of spatial resolution. Chapter 3. Fabrication and characterisation 61 The dwell time t of each pixel is determined by the current I, the step size x and the area dose D, and is ultimately limited by the deﬂection speed of the pattern generator (50 MHz): t = D  x2/I tmin 20 ns. (3.1) If the design is patterned at a lower precision, e.g. by reducing the exposure points by n, the dwell time increases by a factor of n2, allowing to select a larger beamcurrent by increasing the aperture. Since the beam diameter increases with aperture, high-resolution lithography can only be achieved with a small aperture and is relatively slow. Using the 40 µm aperture, the beam current is around 0.6 nA. Using the maximum 500 µm writeﬁeld of the Voyager, one such writeﬁeld typically takes between 5 and 10 minutes to pattern, depending on the complexity of the design. The quasi-random 2D supercell of section 4.3 measures almost 1 cm2 in size and is the largest pattern shown in this thesis, which, using these parameters, took almost 3 days to pattern. However, a new member in the photonics group was recently able to demonstrate 10 h/cm2 by using the 100 µm aperture in a high current mode. At the end, the development step concludes the lithographic process; the sample is developed in X AR 600 from Allresist for 60 seconds and the development is quenched by rinsing in de-ionised water. 3.2.2 Nanoimprint lithography Nanoimprint is an alternative lithography technique, which relies on the mechan- ical deformation of a polymer layer as a mold is pressed into it. The process is therefore analogous to the earliest form of writing, i.e. the imprint of pictographs into a wet clay tablet. This simplicity recommends nanoimprint lithography as a high throughput technique at low-cost. When the technique was invented in 1996 [63], Chou and his students were indeed inspired by the need for a low-cost and high resolution lithography method. Chapter 3. Fabrication and characterisation 62 Today, nanoimprint lithography has started to replace costly equipment tools in research laboratories. Yana et al. [121] and Sohn et al. [122], for example, achieved sub-50 nm resolution on a home-made setup. In the industrial sec- tor, an exciting step was introduced by Molecular Imprints Inc., who used their innovative Jet and Flash Imprint technology  based on drop dispensing of UV curable resists for high resolution patterning  to become the market leader in patterning solutions: the new ImprioTM450 lithography system is capable of patterning entire 450 mm wafers at sub-20 nm resolution in less than 5 seconds, a technique that promises a low cost of ownership. Canon Inc. recently ac- quired this spin-out company of the University of Texas and intends to introduce nanoimprint lithography systems for volume production lines from 2015. Despite these very promising developments, one must not forget that the masters are typically made by e-beam lithography, and that these masters only have a limited lifetime. 3.2.2.1 The imprint step Nanoimprint relies on the plastic properties of a resist material, which needs to (inversely) replicate the nanostructured template as schematically shown in Fig. 3.2. The resist must therefore meet two important properties: a) the need for deformability requires the resist to have a lower Youngs modulus than the stamp; b) the need to ﬁll the trenches requires a low viscosity. If a stamp is pressed into the resist layer, voids may form as the resist material is not able to ﬁll the gaps in the stamp completely. In consequence, air bubbles may remain between the mold and the nanoresist. Applying pressure, temperature or a combination of both can reduce such voids, as long as the ﬂowability of the nanoresist is increased (lower viscosity) by this curing step. At best, the resist material comes as a liquid spin-on solution and is turned into a solid by a short curing process, with the stamp material assisting any capillary action. The problem of ﬁlling all the gaps was solved by the introduction of UV nanoimprint resist which is a low-viscosity solution that can be cross-linked by curing under UV light. Chapter 3. Fabrication and characterisation 63 Fig. 3.2: If a stamp is directly pressed into a material that is softer than the stamp, the imprinted layer is mechanically deformed. By applying tempera- ture, pressure, UV light or a combination of these, the (inverse) replica of the template is then produced in the cured material. However, the resist viscosity and deformability have decisive inﬂuence on the transferred pattern quality. Ideally, the cavities of the structured template will be completely ﬁlled (a), which requires the nanoresist to be of low viscosity. A high viscosity, or a non uniform surface contact between stamp and resist, can result in the formation of voids and in a loss of pattern ﬁdelity (b). By reducing the Youngs modulus of the stamp, a conformal contact can be made (c), but as the elastic contrast between stamp and nanoresist is reduced at the same time, a higher elastic- ity of the stamp material can also limit the pattern resolution. In addition, ﬂexible stamps tend to get swollen by the nanoresist. The downside of UV nanoimprint lithography, however, is that stamp materials need to be optically transparent. While the use of a transparent stamp may allow high-precision alignment, metallic stamps are often more suitable for large-scale production, because of their superior hardness and durability. In addition, if the nanoresist is to be used as an etch mask, UV-cross-linked nanoresists tend to be diﬃcult to remove. The three nanoimprint lithography techniques introduced above are compared in Tab. 3.1. Direct nanoimprint requires a reliable control mechanism to precisely align stamp and substrate parallel to each other, often termed wedge error compensation, whereas thermal nanoimprint requires an accurate temperature control across the surfaces of substrate and stamp. Considering these diﬃculties, I chose to develop a UV nanoimprint tool, because the technical requirements are less demanding: a UV light source for initializing the polymerization reactions, a quartz-disk for the stamp support and a weight for keeping the stamp proﬁle pressed in the liquid resist solution at room temperature during the exposure. Chapter 3. Fabrication and characterisation 64 direct nanoimprint thermal nanoimprint UV nanoimprint direct embossing: thermoplastic deformation: radiation curing: press, step and repeat heat, cool, step and repeat ﬂash, step and repeat no or high viscous resist spin-on resist solution spin-on resist solution 3 GPa s 3 Pa s 3 mPa s high pressures heating/cooling cycle UV light exposure  1, 000 kg/cm2 150 C 1000 mJ/cm2 strong need for uniform requires thermal sets high demands on surface contact matching between chemical and physical substrate and stamp resist properties Tab. 3.1: From left to right: direct nanoimprinting does not require any additional steps and can be used to make complex patterns via multiple im- prints. However, this technique suﬀers from pattern relaxation issues and sets high demands on the uniformity of the surface contact due to the very high pressures used. Thermal nanoimprint lithography requires lower pressure by using elevated temperature for curing (central ﬁgure), but a thermal gradient between the substrate and the stamp can lead to pattern distortions during the cooling cycle, hence can aﬀect the pattern ﬁdelity. UV nanoimprint per- mits a high throughput via step and ﬂash imprint lithography (right ﬁgure), because it does not require high pressures ( 1 kg/cm2) or a temperature con- trol system; its capability, however, strongly depends on the chemistry of the photocurable resist material and it requires either a transparent substrate or a transparent stamp. 3.2.2.2 The demoulding step Although nanoimprint appears to be a simple technique, several points need to be considered: 1. Stamp separation. If the nanoresist layer sticks to the stamp material, it can delaminate from the substrate at the demolding step, or both the imprinted replica and the template patterns could get damaged. Chapter 3. Fabrication and characterisation 65 2. Stress. Internal stress in polymers is a consequence of volume shrinkage (typically 5-15%), for example, during solidiﬁcation as a result of phase transformation or solvent evaporation. Stress can lead to surface instabili- ties, wrinkle formations, pattern relaxation/collapse and hence to a loss of replication ﬁdelity. 3. Etch resistance. If the imprinted patterns need to be transferred from the resist into the substrate, the polymerized nanoresist must also function as a masking layer. Therefore, a good etch selectivity is mandatory for maintaining the pattern deﬁnition. UV nanoimprint lithography succeeded in overcoming the above mentioned issues on a research and industrial level (Molecular Imprints Inc.): (1) For a nondestructive release, the desirable requirements are a low interfacial tension and good structural stability of the imprinted patterns. Treating the stamp with a ﬂuorinated silane therefore greatly helps to reduce any adhesive forces during the demoulding step [123]. In addition, the application of an oxygen plasma or a primer layer to the substrate  prior the deposition of the nanoresist  increases the binding properties and eﬀectively addresses the peel-oﬀissue. (2) The internal stress is often reduced by the so called soft-start cure. A combination of initial slow polymerization (at low UV intensity) and then fast polymerization (at high UV intensity) allows the formation of tightly crosslinked microgels throughout the entire liquid resist volume (gelation), before the ﬁnal vitriﬁcation process starts [124]. Otherwise, increasing the molecular weight of the polymer may also enhance its stress resistance (longer chains have a higher tensile strength), but increase its viscosity. Finally (3), Peroz et al. [125] recently demonstrated a high etching selectivity of 1:15 between imprinted resist and silicon. Chapter 3. Fabrication and characterisation 66 3.3 Pattern transfer by reactive ion etching (RIE) Having generated a resist pattern either by e-beam lithography or by nanoim- print, etching techniques are used to transfer the pattern into the desired mate- rial, with the resist acting as a mask. I can classify etching techniques into wet and dry etching. a) Wet etching. Chemical liquids are used to remove material from the sam- ple. If a speciﬁc pattern is deﬁned by a resist mask on the sample, the material not protected by the mask will be etched away by the chemical solution. However, for substrate materials with a crystal structure, like sil- icon, the chemical reactions tend to occur along deﬁnite crystalline planes. Consequently, chemical solutions can not be used for transferring small sub-micrometer structures from a thin resist layer 1:1 into the surface of silicon. b) Dry etching. The generation of ions and free radicals in a radio frequency (RF) plasma allows to remove the exposed areas of silicon, while a resist mask is protecting the remaining areas from either the physical bombard- ment by ions or the chemical etching by radicals. Reactive ion assisted etching processes (RIE) therefore tend to be highly directional, which en- ables me to transfer a pattern from an overlying masking material to the etched silicon surface with high ﬁdelity. Figure 3.3 schematically compares the wet and dry etching methods. Since the fabrication of sub-micron features requires a good proﬁle control with vertical sidewalls in the silicon substrate layer, all nanostructures in my thesis are realized by means of RIE. Chapter 3. Fabrication and characterisation 67 Fig. 3.3: Comparison of diﬀerent etching techniques. The patterned resist (green) acts as a mask in both cases. I consider etching into silicon. a) wet chemical etching is the immersion of the silicon sample in a chemical bath of TMAH or KOH. The material removal occurs along the crystal planes, which can result in an enlargement of the desired features due to undercuts of the masking resist material. b) dry etching done in vacuum, using a parallel-plate electrode conﬁguration. An RF-frequency is applied to the electrode plates, thereby accelerating reactive radicals from the plasma towards the silicon sam- ple. Reactive ion etching (RIE) is a combination of physical sputtering (which is anisotropic) and chemically driven reactions of activated neutrals (which is isotropic) on the material surface. 3.3.1 Dry-etching in the RIE-system The removal of material requires the formation of volatile compounds by a com- bination of physical bombardment and chemical driven reactions. For example, the main purpose of etching silicon with a ﬂuorine gas is the formation of volatile SiF4 molecules. However, while the physical sputtering is highly directional, the chemical reactions can cause undercuts and reduce the ﬁdelity of the pattern transfer. In order to ensure all reaction products are volatile, it needs the right combination between the physical and chemical etching process. One way to avoid undercuts is to protect the sidewalls with a polymer layer that can be formed during the plasma process. For example, the supply of chlorine or ﬂuorocarbons facilitates the formation of a CxFy ﬁlm preferentially at the trench sidewalls, because the sidewalls are not directly exposed to the ion bombardment. A small hydrogen concentration has been shown to further assist the buildup of this passivation layer [126]. Chapter 3. Fabrication and characterisation 68 Therefore, I decided to use a CHF3 gas for the silicon etching and a graphite stage as the bottom electrode for increasing the generation of ﬂuorocarbons. The silicon etching thus becomes controllable by the ﬂuorine concentration: the higher the ﬂuorine concentration, the greater the ion bombardment and the more frequently chemical reactions occur, and, consequently, the more silicon is etched. For obtaining a high etch rate with smooth and near-vertical sidewalls, I ﬁne tuned the parameter of the RIE process by the addition of ﬂuorine (SF6). As background contamination can result in a loss of process control, the etching takes place in an high vacuum environment ( 30 mTorr). The silicon etching recipe was optimized by all group members and is listed in Tab. 3.2. After each etching step, I eﬀectively remove any resist residuals by a 2 min oxygen plasma treatment, a warm 1165 solution around 30 C and a 15 min piranha bath (H2SO4 : H2O2 = 3 : 1). RF-frequency: 13.56 MHz RF-power: 20 W DC-voltage: 170 V Base pressure:  1 mTorr Process pressure: 25 30 mTorr SF6/CHF3 ratio: 12.5 sccm : 14.5 sccm Etch rate: 2 3 nm/s Tab. 3.2: The RIE system at York is a capacitively coupled RF plasma and set up for smooth sidewall etching of silicon on insulator (SOI). The graphite stage is the powered and smaller electrode plate, restricting the maximum sample size to 7 cm in diameter. The etch rate varies from 2 nm/s (SOI) to 3 nm/s (a-Si:H), allowing reasonable short process windows. Chapter 3. Fabrication and characterisation 69 3.4 Absorption measurements In order to characterise my samples, I built a bespoke absorption measurement setup. Appendix section B provides detailed background information about this setup, while this section describes the calibration procedure. For accurate absorption measurements, the total reﬂection R and total transmis- sion T of a sample should be determined at the same time. However, standard spectrophotometers only allow to measure R and T one after the other and by repositioning the sample. When the spectra are obtained in sequence, the mea- surements could diﬀer either in the angle of incidence or in the illuminated area of the sample, and therefore resulting in artefacts and inaccurate data sets, e.g. the absorption exceeds 1 or falls below 0. In order to avoid such artefacts, I modiﬁed a standard integrating sphere such that R and T are detected simultaneously (see appendix section B). The spectral absorptance A(λ) is deﬁned as the fraction of radiation absorbed at a speciﬁc wavelength λ, i.e. it is the ratio between the absorbed and the incident optical power. Calibration can be understood as the characterization of the experimental conditions, i.e. as a baseline scan. Each component in the setup inﬂuences the detector signal. For example, a sample mounted in the centre of the integrating sphere introduces a systematic error in the measurement, described in Fig. B.1 (see appendix). As long as all subsequent measurements remain aﬀected in the same way, any signal changes can be directly contributed to the absorption of the specimen. Therefore, the more accurate I can make the baseline-scan, the smaller the measurement error will be. I performed the calibration after a 60 min warm up phase of all instruments, which reduces thermal ﬂuctuations and allows a precise absorption measurement A(λ), that can be compared to a computer simulation later. Chapter 3. Fabrication and characterisation 70 3.4.1 Reference measurement  thin ﬁlms Thin-ﬁlms of high-index materials are good references for assessing the measure- ment setup, because the thin ﬁlm acts as a Fabry-Perot cavity, and its properties can be easily calculated via the well-known Airy function. I used two reference samples; the ﬁrst is a 1 µm thin-ﬁlm of crystalline silicon on glass (Fig. 3.4), the second is a polished 220 nm thin-ﬁlm of crystalline silicon on a 2 µm thick insulating oxide layer (SOI), which has been thermally grown on a standard silicon substrate wafer before (Fig. 3.4). Even though the measurement and simulation match reasonable well, the com- parison suggests an insuﬃciently collimated laser beam, because the measured Fabry-Perot fringes show a reduced dynamic range. In order to produce a more collimated beam, a doublet lens would need to be placed at its focal distance from the monochromator. Using an achromatic dou- blet lens at the exit port of the monochromator not only can help to achieve a tighter focus but also a superior oﬀ-axis performance compared to the plano- convex lens used in the setup. However, a non perfectly collimated laser beam will not severely aﬀect the charac- terization of diﬀractive structures, because roughness or surface patterns scatter a large part of the incident light oﬀ-axis. Chapter 3. Fabrication and characterisation 71 Fig. 3.4: Comparison of thin-ﬁlm absorption of a 1 µm thin-ﬁlm of crystalline silicon on glass. The red solid line refers to the measured absorption, the grey solid line shows the absorption measurement of a similar sample found in the literature [127] and the black dotted line represents the theoretical Airy curve. The average values agree extremely well, highlighting that the setup is calibrated well. The small deviation in the magnitude of oscillation suggests an incoherent collimated input beam; the Airy curve assumes a plane wave input, while the measurement uses a collimated point source. Fig. 3.5: Comparison of thin-ﬁlm absorption of a 220 nm thin-ﬁlm of crys- talline silicon on a 2 µm thick oxide layer of a standard SOI wafer. The red solid line refers to the measured absorption, the grey solid line shows the simulated absorption spectrum. The reduced dynamic range of the measured Fabry-Perot fringes compared to the model is probably due to a non perfectly collimated or partly coherent beam as mentioned above. Chapter 3. Fabrication and characterisation 72 3.5 Summary This chapter outlines the fabrication process used for the nanostructures in my thesis. I ﬁrst discussed the key aspects of electron beam lithography, because the e-beam system at York (RAITH Voyager) oﬀered me a fast turnaround time from design to pattern. Electron beam lithography, however, is a serial process that exposes one pixel after the other, so it is still a non acceptable lithography technique in larger scale productions of solar cells. Therefore, I also explore the technical possibilities oﬀered by nanoimprint lithography. After weighing the three most common nanoimprint methods against each other, I chose to design a UV nanoimprint tool based on LEDs, as it does not re- quire high pressures or a temperature control system. Using a bi-layer hard- PDMS/PDMS stamp in combination with the nanoresist AMONIL, the imprint process was successfully tested on a tool constructed by myself (described in appendix section A). The lithography process is followed by a RIE dry-etching, which allows me to transfer the fabricated structures from the resist material into the silicon sub- strate without loss of ﬁdelity. The need for smooth and near-vertical sidewalls involved an RIE parameter study. Finally, I outlined how the absorption of structured samples can experimentally be assessed on a home-made characterization set-up. Therefore, I had modiﬁed a standard integrating sphere such that the total reﬂection and transmission are de- tected simultaneously (see appendix section B). The measurement of crystalline silicon thin-ﬁlms on glass show a good agreement with numerical calculations. Chapter 4 Achievements 4.1 Introduction This chapter outlines two key experiments performed in my PhD project: 1. The ﬁrst experiment highlights a simple layer transfer technique. In a proof-of-principle, I demonstrate the ability to pattern a silicon thin-ﬁlm independently from both sides in section 4.2. My technique could support the study of more eﬃcient light trapping designs without being constraint by design parameters. 2. The second experiment, outlined in section 4.3, concentrates on a fair as- sessment of two diﬀerent light-trapping mechanisms, i.e. diﬀractive vs plas- monic. This comparison is jointly undertaken with colleagues from the Uni- versity of Catania and it highlights the importance of avoiding any optical loss mechanisms in novel light-trapping designs. 73 Chapter 4. Achievements 74 4.2 Dual gratings by a simple layer transfer tech- nique The research community initially focused on one-dimensional (1D) gratings to study the key requirements of light-trapping, because they are less complex and therefore potentially easier to fabricate than two-dimensional (2D) gratings. Al- though 1D designs are simpler to analyze, e.g. numerical simulations require less computational power, 1D structures have a tendency to be most eﬀective for only one polarization. 2D designs are more complex than 1D gratings but show two advantages. Firstly, they can allow to address both polarization states. Secondly, they provide ac- cess to a signiﬁcantly larger number of diﬀraction orders. For these two reasons higher absorption enhancements are expected from 2D gratings and were widely proposed to further explore the interaction of light with textured surfaces. A logical step and further extension was to use gratings on both sides of the ﬁlm, because structuring the absorber layer from both sides increases the degrees of freedom available to the designer, at the cost of increased complexity though. Since 1D gratings tend to have a higher diﬀraction eﬃciency for one polarization, using two diﬀerent 1D gratings on each side could be advantageous for targeting both polarization states separate from each other. In addition, the wavelength spectrum at the rear side is signiﬁcantly reduced compared to the front side, because the silicon absorber functions as a long-pass ﬁlter. A back-side light- trapping structure consequently needs to be designed only for wavelengths that are not absorbed in their ﬁrst pass through the silicon slab. Dual structures were studied by the community [59, 76, 118, 119], but theoretical proposals were generally limited to supercell-type calculations (where the period on one side is the multiple of that on the other) and experimental structures were often restricted to those with the same period on both sides, i.e. deposited by conformal growth techniques (where the structural features of the substrate go all the way through the absorbing material). Developing a simple layer transfer technique would therefore allow to assess ex- perimentally the light-trapping performance of any kind of structure without numerical nor technological constraints. Chapter 4. Achievements 75 4.2.1 Why dual gratings ? Although diﬀraction is a wavelength-dependent phenomenon, light-trapping struc- tures need to operate broadband in order to exploit the incident sunlight. The ability to independently structure both sides of a thin-ﬁlm absorber could allow one to combine two diﬀerent optical functions then: while the top grating could be optimized for light in-coupling and anti-reﬂection action in the visible part of the spectrum, the longer wavelengths could be diﬀracted by the bottom grating design so as to enhance their optical path length through the absorber slab. For example, light below 600 nm wavelength is absorbed in silicon within the ﬁrst micrometre, whereas light above 800 nm wavelength usually requires path lengths of at least 10 µm. Using a dual grating design would thus allow one to take advantage of the full beneﬁts that a texture can oﬀer and may even allow thin-ﬁlm cells to approach the Lambertian limit more closely. Thin-ﬁlm absorber layers, however, are generally obtained by vacuum deposition methods onto a bulk substrate. The substrate then impedes direct access to the back side of the absorber slab, which is therefore not available for patterning. In the following, I will brieﬂy list a few currently known layer transfer methods, before outlining a novel but simple alternative technique. As a proof-of-principle demonstration and by choosing two diﬀerent designs on each side of a silicon slab, I was able to fabricate a dual grating structure and managed to show good agreement between the measured and the simulated absorption spectra. 4.2.2 A novel layer-transfer technique Zeng et al. [128] were able to directly bond the silicon device layer of a SOI wafer to a new handle wafer and to remove the original substrate by etching afterwards. The bonding of the silicon surface to the new substrate, however, was very unreliable and involved a high temperature annealing step between 600 and 1000 C. Chapter 4. Achievements 76 Cruz-Campa et al. [129] were able to demonstrate how 14 µm thin and 15% eﬃ- cient silicon solar cells can be released from the original substrate wafer. However, the processing involved ﬁve etching steps and long submersion in potassium hy- droxide (KOH). Petermann et al. [130] produced a mesoporous double layer by electrochemical etching, which facilitated the lift-oﬀof a vapour deposited silicon layer. They then used this technique to fabricate a 43 µm thick and 19% eﬃcient silicon solar cell. All the three techniques, mentioned above, require expensive vaccuum equipment tools and are not easy to reproduce. Instead, a simple layer transfer method could be characterised by 1. low-cost (avoids the need for vacuum equipment), 2. easy handling and processing steps, 3. unaﬀected silicon material properties, 4. short waiting times (avoids etching or high temperature cycles), 5. high yield. My novel idea combines the use of an optical adhesive with the transfer of the thin-ﬁlm to a new carrier. This combination automatically meets the ﬁve criteria mentioned above. For a microscope glass slide as the carrier, a high yield may also be obtained, because optical adhesives naturally conform to glass. Since the patterning of a material generally involves at least one lithography step, the glue must retain its optical and adhesive properties after short baking periods or chemical solutions that are typically used to develop/strip a resist material. The optical adhesive NOA61 from Norland fulﬁls these secondary conditions. According to the manufacturer, NOA61 withstands temperatures up to 260 C as a coating on the surface of a substrate for three hours. I tested the glue to be highly resistant to most chemicals (even to HF) and temperatures up to 180 C on a hot plate for short times. Chapter 4. Achievements 77 To guarantee a strong bonding to NOA61, the surfaces of both the foreign sub- strate and the thin-ﬁlm layer must be clean, dry and highly hydrophilic, which can generally be achieved by piranha solutions or a plasma ashing with oxygen ions. Before the optical glue is then drop casted onto the thin-ﬁlm, the surface energy can even further be increased by pre-heating the samples on a hot plate above 100 C. The heat treatment of NOA61 improves the homogeneity of the adhesive and also avoids the formation of cracks, while a spinning process afterwards can help to achieve a ﬂat and uniform coating layer. At the end, the microscope glass slide is simply placed onto the liquid glue as the new carrier and cured under UV light (3 J/cm2). Following exposure, the two carriers can be simply prised apart, which ﬁnishes the layer transfer process. The technique relies on the fact that the thin ﬁlm adheres more strongly to the cured NOA61 than to the original carrier. I was able to transfer amorphous silicon thin-ﬁlms up to 4 cm2 surface area by using the above procedure. 4.2.3 Proof of principle demonstration As a proof of principle, I chose to pattern a 400 nm thin-ﬁlm of hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) from both sides. The process ﬂow is schematically shown in Fig. 4.1. 4.2.3.1 Fabrication and design parameters of the dual-grating As 2D square lattices of holes have previously been considered for light trapping [43], I decided to use two such lattices of the same period of 300 nm, but which greatly diﬀer in their ﬁll factors. Keeping the period the same on both sides of the absorber makes the subsequent numerical comparison easier. Chapter 4. Achievements 78 Fig. 4.1: The layer transfer technique relies on the fact that the thin-ﬁlm adheres more strongly to the cured optical adhesive NOA61 than to the original carrier. (a) Following the deposition and patterning of the thin-ﬁlm, (b) the optical adhesive NOA61 from Norland is spin coated onto the surface. (c) A glass slide is then placed onto the liquid glue as the new carrier. NOA61 will solidify under UV light exposure (3 J/cm2), which permits the two carriers to be prised apart, thereby leaving the thin-ﬁlm bonded to the new carrier. (d) Since the layer-transfer technique allows us to get access to the back side of the thin-ﬁlm, both sides of the ﬁlm can now be structured independently and without any restrictions on the design parameters. The fabricated top and bottom gratings can be seen in Fig. 4.2 and are clearly distinguishable by their design aspects. The bottom grating appears as a well- deﬁned 2D lattice of holes, while the topography of the top grating rather re- sembles a square lattice of star-like columns in air. Both structures were realized by electron beam lithography and reactive ion etching (see chapter 3). However, since warm chemical solutions (above 30 C) can dissolve NOA61, the resist ma- terial was eﬀectively removed by means of an oxygen plasma, instead of using the standard resist remover 1165. A top view image of the ﬁnal sample is shown in Fig. 4.3 along with a cross- section of the completed structure. Chapter 4. Achievements 79 Fig. 4.2: Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the 2D square lat- tices used for the dual-grating approach. Both gratings have the same period of 300 nm in order to facilitate the computational comparison. (a) The bot- tom grating is a photonic lattice of holes in a-Si:H with 240 nm diameters and 60 nm etching depth. Norlands optical adhesive NOA61 has highly transpar- ent properties; its refractive index of 1.56 is very similar to SiO2. (b) The holes of the top grating touch each other, as the diameter was set equal to the lattice period. Therefore, the structure rather simulates star-like columns of a-Si:H in air. The nominal etch depth is 80 nm. Fig. 4.3: (a) Microscope image (top view) of the 2D dual interface grating fabricated in a 400 nm thin a-Si:H slab on glass. The top and bottom grating are independently patterned by electron beam lithography and have been oﬀ- set to allow individual optical characterisation.

Achievements 80 4.2.3.2 Measurements and results First, the measured absorption spectrum of the as-deposited a-Si:H ﬁlm is com- pared with a numerical simulation in Fig. 4.4. The comparison reveals a good agreement and also veriﬁes the optical material properties used in the model. The required dielectric function was obtained by variable angle spectroscopic el- lipsometry (VASE) conducted by M. Patrini from the University of Pavia. The absorption measurements of the bottom, top and double-sided gratings are then compared in Fig. 4.5 to the spectra calculated by P. Kowalczewski of the University of Pavia. In all cases, a very good agreement is seen. Notably, the spectrum of the dual-grating structure combines features of both individual grat- ings. Tab. 4.1 summarizes the measured integrated absorption and the absorption enhancement achieved by the diﬀerent structures. Since the optical properties of NOA61 are designed to resemble those of glass, the refractive index of the glue and the glass substrate are kept the same in all calculations. Since the top grating provides anti-reﬂection action and diﬀraction into the a- Si:H slab, it outperforms the bottom grating (32% vs 25%). For example, most of the incident short-wavelength light will be absorbed during its ﬁrst pass through the material layer, such that the bottom grating alone can eﬃciently address only the (non-reﬂected) longer wavelengths.

The results are also compared with a modelled reference sample consisting of a Ag reﬂector at the back and a 70 nm Si3N4 anti-reﬂection coating layer at the front (last column). Please note that for the unpatterned ﬁlm without mirror and anti-reﬂection coating the calculated absorption is 22% and thus 7% higher compared to the measurement, which explains the lower enhancement factor of the simulated structure. The combination of both gratings further improves the absorption enhancement, yet the improvement is rather modest. The 2D grating structures were indeed not optimized to yield optimal light-trapping, but were rather chosen to simplify the comparison with a model. Essentially, I used the dual-grating approach as a vehicle to demonstrate the layer-transfer technique. Therefore, if the individual gratings were optimized, higher performances should be possible. Finally, as the propagation lengths are longer in indirect bandgap materials, microcrystalline silicon would beneﬁt more from such a dual-grating approach, but I did not have a source of this material available in order to conduct the comparison. Chapter 4. Achievements 82 4.2.3.3 Conclusions Using Norland Optical Adhesive 61 (NOA61), I outlined a simple layer trans- fer technique that allowed me to successfully pattern a 400 nm thin a-Si:H ﬁlm on glass from both sides independently. In addition, the measured absorption characteristic of the dual-grating structure stands in very good agreement with numerical simulations. Since the dual-grating shows a higher absorption en- hancement over a single grating structure either on top or bottom of the ﬁlm, the greater performance does also highlight the promise of the dual-grating ap- proach. My study serves as a proof-of-principle demonstration. If a back-reﬂector and anti-reﬂection coating layer were included and the textures designed to yield max- imum light absorption in the active silicon material, further improvements will be clearly possible. My layer transfer technique opens a new way to study dual interface gratings with no restrictions on the design parameters of each grating. 4.3 Plasmonic and diﬀractive nanostructures for light trapping  an experimental compari- son In 2008 Catchpole and Polman [131] highlighted the potential beneﬁt of metallic nanoparticles for light trapping. The authors idea is based around the collec- tive oscillations of the conduction electrons in the metal, commonly known as localized surface plasmon modes. Noble metal nanoparticles, if excited at their surface plasmon resonance, can become strong scatterers with scattering cross- sectional areas well exceeding the particles size. Two years later, the nature article from Atwater and Polman [20] further trig- gered many new research activities in the ﬁeld of plasmonics for photovoltaics. Despite the fact that both diﬀractive nanostructures and metal nanoparticle scatterers have been widely studied for light trapping, a direct, clear and unbiased comparison between the two has not been carried out yet. Chapter 4. Achievements 83 The diﬃculty of such a comparison is to keep the absorber material the same, to use an identical anti-reﬂection coating layer, to account properly for any parasitic eﬀects such as absorption in the metal nanoparticles (or any contact layer) and to retain all electrical properties in order to allow a fair assessment of the light- trapping mechanism. Plasmonic solar cells are usually fabricated in a substrate conﬁguration, i.e. the absorber material is deposited onto the metallic nanoparticles. By depositing the absorber material onto the metallic nanoparticles, the particles will add a texture to the active layer and throughout the solar cell device [23, 25], which creates a surface relief that contributes to the scattering properties of the layer. Consequently, the optical eﬀects of the surface interfere with a proper assessment of the plasmonic scattering-properties. 4.3.1 Methodology In order to keep the comparison simple, I decided to use identical absorber ma- terial that was structured after deposition and annealing, and used absorption measurements to qualify each light trapping approach. Regarding the light trap- ping nanostructures, I compared a quasi-random supercell diﬀractive nanostruc- ture [92, 113] with a layer of self-assembled metal nanoparticles on a 240 nm thin non-hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si) slab on glass; 240 nm is a thickness close to the value used in thin ﬁlm solar cells [29]. In a joint project with CNR-IMM Catania, who are specialized in plasmonic structures for light-trapping, each research group fabricated their own design on an identical slab of a-Si, i.e. without the usual rear mirror implemented in plasmonic backreﬂectors [25, 29, 132]. If the samples were then illuminated from the glass substrate ﬁrst, the performance of the two diﬀerent light-trapping concepts can be directly compared  irrespective of anti-reﬂective, Fabry-Perot interferences or material properties, as these were all kept the same. Chapter 4. Achievements 84 Fig. 4.6: (a) Diﬀractive 2D quasi-periodic nanostructure, optimized to chan- nel more energy into the higher diﬀraction orders; (b) plasmonic nanostructure designed to scatter light eﬃciently into the silicon layer. Both approaches have been realized on the back of a 240 nm a-Si absorber slab. The white arrows in the bottom sketches indicate the illumination direction. 4.3.1.1 The diﬀractive design For the diﬀractive design, I fabricated the quasi-random supercell structure [92, 113] shown in Fig. 4.6a by means of electron beam lithography and reac- tive ion etching. The supercells period and nominal etch depth are 1.8 µm and 85 nm, respectively. The supercell concept had previously been demonstrated as one of the most eﬀective light-trapping techniques [92, 133], while only relying on a binary grat- ing approach that could be mass-produced using nanoimprint technology [63]. A Fourier analysis (see bottom sketch in Fig. 4.6a) demonstrates the working principle for the high performance of the design: since the structure is able to channel more energy into the higher diﬀraction orders, more light can couple into the quasi-guided propagating modes of the thin-ﬁlm, thereby leading to increased optical pathlengths in the absorber slab [58]. Even if the supercell can additionally provide anti-reﬂection action when used at the front surface, the supercell is here situated on the rear side in order to assess only the diﬀractive eﬀects, and light enters the absorber through the glass- semiconductor interface ﬁrst. Chapter 4. Achievements 85 4.3.1.2 The plasmonic design The plasmonic design consists of self-assembled silver nanoparticles in direct con- tact with the high-index a-Si layer, an approach that has previously shown strong eﬃciency enhancements of almost 30% [25, 134]. Silver (Ag) not only has a low imaginary permittivity, but also a high scattering eﬃciency in the visible and near-infrared spectrum [135]. In addition, placing the nanoparticles onto the rear side of the absorber was shown to be more advan- tageous for light trapping than locating them at the front [136]. Thirdly, since the optical density of states in a a semiconductor is higher than in air or silica, it is advantageous to place the scattering centres directly onto the a-Si slab to maximize coupling between the scatterer and the absorber layer [137]. The plasmonic structure is shown in Figure 4.6b and was obtained by a post- deposition annealing step of 13 nm Ag on a-Si for 1 hour at 450 C in N2 atmo- sphere. 4.3.2 Results 4.3.2.1 Material properties While the optical bandgap E04 before annealing was 1.9 eV, it was 1.7 eV after the annealing step. The optical band gap of thin ﬁlm materials, however, varies substantially with deposition conditions. For example, Bakr et al. [138] report optical gaps between 1.8 and 2 eV, whereas G. Cody and T. Tiedje et al. [87] cite values between 1.4 and 1.8 eV. To ensure that the a-Si absorber slabs are all identical, a thermal treatment at 450 C in N2 atmosphere was carried out before the plasmonic and diﬀractive nanostructures were realized. The material properties relevant for the study (n and k data) were then carefully measured by variable angle spectroscopic ellip- sometry (VASE by Woollam Inc.) and plotted in Fig. 4.7. In order to check whether the amorphous silicon contains a crystalline phase, Micro-Raman measurements were performed using a HORIBA XploRA instru- ment with a 532 nm laser excitation wavelength, x50 magniﬁcation and a 2,400 gr/mm grating. Chapter 4. Achievements 86 For the measurements, 2 mW and 5 mW optical power were used at the deposited sample (a-Si:H) and the thermal treated sample (a-Si), respectively. The spectra were obtained using 45 3-second acquisitions over which each spectrum was av- eraged. The material was optically and spectrally veriﬁed to be free of any laser damage. In Fig. 4.8, both the deposited and the annealed ﬁlm show the broad TO peak of a-Si instead of the typical band of crystalline silicon at 520 cm1 (used for the calibration of the measurements). Therefore, no crystalline phase is present in the sample. Fig. 4.7: The graphs show the extinction coeﬃcient (red curve, left axis) and the refractive index (blue curve, right axis) of the a-Si, respectively, used in the experiment. The values were determined by variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometry (VASE by Woollam Inc.). The material functions of the a-Si:H, used in section 4.2, are also shown for comparison. Fig. 4.8: Normalized Raman spectra of the 240 nm thick hydrogenated a- Si:H thin ﬁlm, before (red) and after (blue) a 60 min post-thermal treatment at 450 C in N2 atmosphere. The blue curve, post-annealing, is slightly broad- ened. This broadening can be explained by the outdiﬀusion of hydrogen, which induces disorder, while the presence of hydrogen atoms increases the structural order by stabilizing the amorphous network. Chapter 4. Achievements 87 4.3.2.2 Absorption measurements All samples were carefully characterized by following the method described in section 3.4, and the measured absorption spectra are then plotted in Fig. 4.9. The quasi-random supercell clearly outperforms the plasmonic nanoparticles in the visible range between 550 and 700 nm, while the opposite is true in the near- infrared (700 - 1000 nm) where the plasmonic structure clearly causes higher light absorption. The key question is therefore whether the observed absorption is due to stronger scattering of the plasmonic nanoparticles, or whether it is due to un- desired parasitic absorption of the metal. On the one hand, previous studies suggest that for the metal particle sizes in- volved (170 nm  90 nm) the parasitic absorption becomes minimal in the long wavelength regime [132, 134]. In fact, according to simple Mie theory the scat- tering eﬃciency of a single (spherical) nanoparticle scales with the square of its volume, whereas the absorption eﬃciency scales only linearly with the particle volume [139]. This argument therefore favours the assumption that the observed high absorption in the near-infrared is mainly due to the strong scattering of plasmonic nanoparticles. Fig. 4.9: Measured total absorption of the unstructured a-Si slab (black solid line), with added diﬀractive structure (green short-dashed line) and with added plasmonic structure (blue long-dashed line). Chapter 4. Achievements 88 On the other hand, Schmid et al. [140] showed that the transition from a single nanoparticle to a density of particles already modiﬁes the scattering performances predicted by Mie theory. The high absorption together with the weak wavelength dependence, as observed here between 800 and 1000 nm, thus could also be dom- inated by the parasitic losses in the metal as it has already been pointed out before [24, 29, 141, 142]. 4.3.3 Discussion Mie theory is often intended to provide a ﬁrst-order estimation of the nanopar- ticles performances [134]. While the theory predicts a low parasitic absorption for our particle sizes involved (170 nm  90 nm), the scattered light can come back to the plasmonic particles and be scattered or absorbed again, and again. Consequently, a small parasitic absorption may accumulate to a sizeable absorp- tion overall [143145]. For example, even if only 10% of the light is absorbed and 90% is scattered, at long wavelengths, the light will make many round-trips, in- teract with the nanoparticles more often and eventually be absorbed parasitically. Therefore, the parasitics have to go up at long wavelengths, as the amorphous silicon becomes transparent (see subsubsection 4.3.2.1). To quantify the parasitic absorption in plasmonic nanostructures, I therefore sug- gested to consider the cumulative parasitics that may arise from the multipass nature of trapped light. I extended the lossy waveguide model outlined in section 2.3 by adding a parasitic loss term for each reﬂection at the nanoparticle layer. My main assumption here is the inseparability of scattering and parasitic absorption; once the light interacts with the nanoparticle and scatters, it will experience absorption at the same time. This relationship is indeed intrinsic to Mie theory and was also highlighted by Sun and Khurgin [146]. As a result, minimising the parasitic losses is of critical importance, because the desired scattering properties are directly to these undesired parasitic losses. Figure 4.10 schematically illustrates the extended model, which is based on further two intuitive assumptions: Chapter 4. Achievements 89 1. Firstly, since the nanoparticles are broadly distributed and the light is ran- domized at every reﬂection, the scattering from the metal nanoparticles will be incoherent. As a result, the (coherent) Fabry-Perot interference fringes around 600-700 nm are then averaged out. I believe that non-coherence is an acceptable simpliﬁcation, because averaging these fringes does not aﬀect the integrated short-circuit current. 2. Secondly, the metal nanoparticles scatter Lambertionally. Although nanopar- ticles are often considered within a point-dipole description, the angular distribution of the scattered light was shown to be similar to the Lamber- tian case, when Ag nanoparticles were directly situated on the substrate [144]. Lambertian scattering does also take into account light that is cou- pled into the waveguide by the average scattering angle  in contrast to haze (the non-specular part of reﬂection), which has no direction. Fig. 4.10: When randomization of light at the scattering layer allows to neglect coherent eﬀects, the propagation of an averaged light ray in a lossy waveguide is described by the external reﬂection Rext, the internal eﬀective reﬂectances Rf and Rr, the parasitic metal absorption Ap and the attenu- ated transmission Tr with respect to the single-pass traversal Tf. The incident medium is assumed to be glass, as all measurements were normalized to a reference glass cover slide. Chapter 4. Achievements 90 4.3.3.1 Extraction of the parasitic inﬂuences Using the terms deﬁned in Fig. 4.10, the total absorption Atot can now be calcu- lated in analogy to Eq. 2.13 via Asim tot = Z   1 Tf  1 Ap Rr  1 Tr +  1 Tr Tf   Rf Tr    . (4.1) The recirculation factor Z = (1Rext)/(1RrTrRfTr) takes into account the at- tenuation of the average light ray due to the multiple upward and downward reﬂections at the cladding layers. Since the optical constants (n, k) and the thickness d of the a-Si slab are all known, Tf, Tr and Rf can be readily calcu- lated via Eq. 2.7 and Eq. 2.10, such that all parameters in Eq. 4.1 are determined  except for Rr (the eﬀective backreﬂection from the nanoparticle layer) and Ap (the parasitic absorption). In the following analysis, I will assume that the values for Rr and Ap are constant across the spectral range of interest. My key argument for spectrally constant ﬁtting parameters is that Mie theory clearly shows that the plasmonic response is ﬂat below 2 eV for particles 100 nm. In fact, Morawiec and Tan et al. [24, 134] experimentally veriﬁed that the resonance is very broad, and almost ﬂat, in the corresponding wavelength range (600-1000 nm). Using the least square method, I then compare in Fig. 4.11a the diﬀerence be- tween the simulated and measured absorption spectrum as a function of the eﬀective backreﬂection Rr and the parasitic absorption Ap. The ﬁtting outcome allows me to determine the best parameter set (Rr, Ap) = (34%, 20%) directly from the contour plot. Fig. 4.11b ﬁnally compares the best ﬁt to the measured data curve. One could question the uniqueness of the result, because a range of (Rr, Ap) values can be used to achieve a good ﬁt in Fig. 4.11b. However, the goal of the analysis is not to precisely quantify the parasitics at each wavelength, but to estimate the overall parasitic losses. These losses are shown as the red curve in Fig. 4.11, and I note that the red curve is very robust against variations (see subsubsection 4.3.1.2): demonstrating little diﬀerence between a range of ﬁtting Chapter 4. Achievements 91 Fig. 4.11: Analysis of the modelled parasitic absorption caused by the metal nanoparticles. (a) Using the least square method, the diﬀerence between the simulated and measured total absorption Atot is shown as a contour plot as a function of the eﬀective backreﬂection Rr and the parasitic absorption Ap. I used the inverse of the residual (1/Aexp Asim) as it brings out the diﬀerences more clearly. (b) The measurement is then compared to the best ﬁt with Rr = 34% and Ap = 20%. Higher or lower values of Rr would overestimate either the measured absorption or the parasitics in the visible range, respectively, where most of the light does not reach the backscattering layer or only interacts once with the metal nanoparticles. parameters shows that the overall conclusion is robust, generally applicable and not restricted to the speciﬁc details of the plasmonic structure. Therefore, I varied the (Rr, Ap) values in the range of 25%  Rr  50% and 13%  Ap  25%, while maintaining a good ﬁt to the experimental curve. As a result, I could indeed verify no remarkable diﬀerences in the overall parasitic losses, represented by the red curves in Fig. 4.11. This ﬁnding can also be understood intuitively: if Rr increases, the lightpath will be longer and the light experiences the parasitic absorption more often, hence Rr and Ap are somewhat interchangeable without aﬀecting the ﬁnal result. In order to dispel any ﬁnal doubts on the generality of the conclusion, I also analysed the measured data by using resonant and wavelength-dependent ﬁtting- parameters; maybe the assumption of wavelength-independent scattering and ab- sorption parameters is not correct after all ? To address this question, I assumed Chapter 4. Achievements 92 a Lorentzian lineshape Rb = RSi/air(λ) + 0.45  3002 (λ 975)2 + 3002 Ap = 0.12  3002 (λ 975)2 + 3002 , (4.2) Fig. 4.12 again shows that a very good ﬁt can be achieved, and that the red curve of parasitic absorption is very similar as before (Fig. 4.11). I can thus conclude from the multipass approach that the total parasitic absorption represents a total loss of 12 +/- 2%, irrespective of the assumptions used. Fig. 4.12: For wavelength-dependent ﬁtting parameters (left), a good agree- ment with the measurement data (right) is found by assuming the Lorentzian resonance of Eq. 4.2. 4.3.4 Comparison of the two diﬀerent approaches Having determined the total parasitic loss, I am now able to isolate the useful absorption from Fig. 4.9, simply by subtracting the parasitic losses from the measured absorption. For comparison, I also included the unstructured reference and an ideal Lambertian backreﬂector in Fig. 4.13. Over the full wavelength range, the quasi-random supercell now outperforms the plasmonic design. In order to quantify the diﬀerences in performance, I use the LTE introduced in subsection 2.4.2. I ﬁrst calculated the short-circuit current Jsc of the plasmonic device via Jsc = e hc  1,000 nm Z 400 nm Aexp(λ)   1 Ap,tot(λ) Atot(λ)   λ dI dλ  dλ, (4.3) Chapter 4. Achievements 93 Fig. 4.13: By separating the parasitic contribution from the total absorption in Fig. 4.9, the graphs describe the absorption in silicon only. While the plasmonic structure (blue long-dashed line) can enhance the absorption of an unstructured a-Si slab (black solid line) by 7%, the diﬀractive structure (green short-dashed line) is able to do so by 25%. For comparison, the red solid line corresponds to the theoretical absorption of an ideal Lambertian backscatterer. where I subtracted the total parasitics Ap,tot from the measured absorption Aexp. For simplicity, I assumed the internal quantum-eﬃciency to be unity over the AM1.5 global solar spectrum [89] dI/dλ. Note that this simpliﬁcation is artiﬁcial and must be dropped when the electric short-circuit current is experimentally assessed, because embedding the comparison into a solar cell would not only require more layers and (optical) interfaces, the assessment would necessarily involve additional eﬀects, such as the electrical, chemical and thermal properties of the device. The impact and interplay of these eﬀects would not only screen the key parameters for light-trapping, but also make it more diﬃcult to extract a clear conclusion in respect to the light-trapping mechanism itself. Here, I do not try to address the question whether the best light-trapping strategy also maximizes the overall power conversion eﬃciency  this is a diﬀerent research question beyond the scope of my analysis. Similarly, I then calculated the implied Jsc of the unstructured reference and of the diﬀractive structure, but without the Ap term. The results are listed in Tab. 4.2. Chapter 4. Achievements 94 Absorption Jsc LTE unstructured reference 35.7 % 13.5 0 % plasmonic light-trapping 38.3 % 14.6 14.2 % diﬀractive light-trapping 44.8 % 17.1 47.8 % Lambertian backscatterer 55.5 % 21.3 100 % in mA/cm2 Tab. 4.2: Comparison of the integrated silicon absorption, the calculated short-circuit current Jsc and the LTE [11] for the 400 to 1000 nm wavelength range. The LTE related to the diﬀractive approach is so low, because the supercell was originally designed for light in-coupling and would thus perform better on the front (LTE = 0.68). However, the aim of the present study was to quantita- tively compare the light-trapping mechanisms by keeping all other parameters as identical as possible, rather than optimising the overall performance of each approach. 4.3.5 Conclusions Plasmonic and diﬀractive light-trapping using photonic nanostructures has been compared experimentally. Corresponding nanostructures have been placed on the rear side of an absorber slab. Since the incident light will pass through the glass substrate and amorphous silicon layer ﬁrst, the absorption enhancement can be directly related to the scattering and diﬀractive properties of the structures. In fact, while previous conclusions have been screened by additional eﬀects or were biased toward a particular approach [23, 24, 147, 148] (with a corresponding loss of generality), using the simplest possible platform enabled me to make a clear and unbiassed comparison of these two light-trapping mechanisms. For extracting the parasitic metal absorption and the assessment of the light- trapping performances, I had to the extend the simple analytical model outlined in section 2.3. The analysis turned out to be robust even for a diﬀerent functional dependence of the parasitic absorption. Chapter 4. Achievements 95 While Ingenito et al. [149] already proposed a similar method to diﬀerentiate be- tween the absorptance in silicon and metal, their empirical model only describes a single pass through the material. This can be seen by assuming the silicon to be only weakly absorptive ASi 0 and by expressing the metal absorption AAg from Eq. 4 and 5 q.v. AAg = 1 Rair/Si    X m=0 R@1200 RSi/air m  (1 R@1200) . (4.4) Here, R@1200 is the measured total reﬂection at 1200 nm wavelength, whereas RSi/air and Rair/Si are the external Fresnel reﬂection at air/Si of Eq. 2.1 and the eﬀective internal back reﬂection Si/air of Eq. 2.7, respectively. As the model by Ingenito et al. uses only the ﬁrst term (m = 0), it would not correctly represent the multi-pass nature of a waveguiding system and, therefore, does not facilitate the separate determination of the plasmonic nanoparticles reﬂectivity and absorption. The accurate modelling of non-identical and randomly distributed metal nanopar- ticles has not been demonstrated yet, because of the diﬃculties set by the ran- dom nature of the particles shape, size and volume as seen in Fig. 4.6. The lack of order, for example, leads to agglomerations and thus enhanced inter-particle interactions, which are known to reduce the plasmonic resonances [142, 150]. Secondly, both the absorption and the scattering cross section of a nanoparticle usually exceed the particle size, such that a computational cell is diﬃcult to de- ﬁne. Plasmonic resonances are also quite sensitive to the area in contact with the substrate [144] and to defects in the nanoparticles shell [135]. If a numerical computation were to include all of the above eﬀects, the modelling would become complex or run into convergence problems due to the required ﬁne meshes. Finally, although thicker metal nanoparticles may scatter even more strongly and absorb less according to Mie theory, the variations would be small. For example, previous works had highlighted that the best performing nanoparticles diﬀer by less than 10% [134]. Equally, Tan et al. [24] reported that the variation between diﬀerent size plasmonic nanoparticles only leads to a ca. 10% variation in haze in reﬂection in the important 600-900 nm regime. Therefore, the outcomes in this study would not diﬀer much if better nanoparticles were used. Chapter 4. Achievements 96 The comparison reveals that a quasi-random supercell diﬀractive grating en- hances the silicon absorption compared to an unstructured slab by 25%, whereas randomly distributed silver nanoparticles are only able to do so by less than 10%. Even though the high parasitics are responsible for the poor performance of the silver nanoparticles, they should be less detrimental in a real solar cell conﬁgura- tion, because nanoparticles show a stronger scattering performance when coupled to a rear mirror [25, 132, 139]. In conclusion, diﬀractive light trapping outperforms plasmonic light trapping due to the cumulative parasitics arising from multipath interactions at metal nanoparticles. 4.4 Summary By using an optical adhesive to aid the transfer of a silicon thin-ﬁlm to a new carrier, I developed a simple method for patterning before and after the transfer process without restrictions on the design parameters. In a proof-of-principle- demonstration, I etched two diﬀerent 2D gratings into the top and bottom of a 400 nm thin-ﬁlm of hydrogenated amorphous silicon. The absorption measure- ments could indeed highlight the promise of this approach, because the dual structure showed an appreciable improvement over single gratings patterned ei- ther on the top or bottom of the ﬁlm (see section 4.2). To study and to quantify the impact of parasitic eﬀects on the silicon absorption enhancement, we decided to compare two diﬀerent light-trapping mechanisms. In a joint project with CNR-IMM Catania, each research group fabricated their own design on an identical silicon slab. We used a quasi-random diﬀractive structure, which I had etched into the silicon surface, whereas the research group of Catania focused on self-assembled silver nanoparticles as strong scatterers for the incident light. While Mie theory predicts a low parasitic absorption for the metallic particles, this theory neglects that scattered light can come back to the particles and be scattered or absorbed again. I developed a model for the extraction of the parasitic inﬂuence by considering the cumulative parasitics that may arise from Chapter 4. Achievements 97 many round-trips of trapped light (see section 4.3). My analysis turned out to be robust even for diﬀerent functional dependencies of the parasitic absorption, such that we could generally state that diﬀractive light-trapping structures tend to be a better choice for photovoltaic applications, because of the cumulative parasitics arising from multipath interactions at the metallic nanoparticles. Chapter 5 Conclusions and outlook 5.1 General conclusions and remarks A large number of diﬀerent types of light-trapping structures for thin-ﬁlm solar cells have been proposed over the last decades. In order to provide a uniﬁed, objective and quantitative assessment of the diﬀerent structures, I have developed a ﬁgure-of-merit in chapter 2, called the light-trapping eﬃciency (LTE), which aims to assess the performance of the nanostructure itself. The LTE separates the light trapping eﬀect from the material, the absorber thickness, the fabrication method and the light-trapping method. The LTE enabled me to compile a ranking list of state-of-the-art proposals in Tab. 2.1 to Tab. 2.3. Compiling this list allowed me to draw four general design rules, which I will comment on in the following paragraphs. 1. Sub-wavelength structures oﬀer the possibility of suppressing the surface reﬂection over the useable solar spectrum (see subsection 2.2.2), and can replace, in fact outperform, antireﬂection coatings. 2. Since the absorber slab acts as a long-pass ﬁlter for the incident sunlight, structures on the back side of the absorber only need to address a reduced wavelength range. 98 Chapter 5. Conclusions 99 3. Whether a structure presents a periodic or random arrangement of scatter- ers can be considered as less important than its local geometrical features (see section 2.6). 4. Parasitical loss mechanisms are of critical importance and must be avoided when the active absorber material becomes weakly absorptive. The ﬁrst two design rules are addressed by research studies focusing on dual- grating structures. In fact, structuring a thin-ﬁlm absorber layer from both sides allows us to take advantage of the full beneﬁts that textures can oﬀer. However, theoretical proposals are often limited to supercell-type calculations (where the period on one side is the multiple of that on the other), whereas experimental structures were restricted to those with the same period on both sides (where the structural features of the substrate go all the way through the absorbing material). By using an optical adhesive to aid the transfer of a silicon thin-ﬁlm to a new carrier, I developed a simple method for patterning before and after the transfer process without restrictions on the design parameters. In a proof-of-principle- demonstration, I etched two diﬀerent 2D gratings into the top and bottom of a 400 nm thin-ﬁlm of hydrogenated amorphous silicon. The absorption measure- ments could indeed highlight the promise of this approach, because the dual structure showed an appreciable improvement over single gratings patterned ei- ther on the top or bottom of the ﬁlm (see section 4.2). The third design rule is derived from the fact that neither completely random nor conpletely periodic structures are able to maximize the absorption enhance- ment over a broadband spectrum (see section 2.2). The most promising light trapping structures tend to lie between these two domains. This observation can be understood in the framework of diﬀractive optics: While the lower diﬀraction orders generally being more intense in random and periodic designs, the higher diﬀraction orders are more likely to be totally (in- ternally) reﬂected at the cladding of a silicon slab, thereby experiencing a longer path length in the absorber layer. As typical structural features form the building blocks of diﬀraction patterns, their local arrangement thus needs to guarantee a Chapter 5. Conclusions 100 suppression of the lower orders so as to enhance diﬀraction into the higher orders  which in turn will increase the optical absorption due to their longer paths. The appropriate level of (dis)order in the diﬀractive structures used in my thesis has been tuned by using its Fourier spectrum as a tool. For the fabrication, I used electron beam lithography and reactive ion etching (see chapter 3). Since electron beam lithography is a pixel by pixel exposure, and thus is relatively slow, I also developed a tool for exploring the technical possibilities oﬀered by nanoimprint lithography in A. The setup I used for characterizing the absorption of my samples is described in section 3.4. Having gained theoretical and experimental expertise in the design of eﬃcient light trapping structures, I noticed the need for theoretical descriptions to be more comprehensive, as not all relevant optical losses are generally taken into account (fourth design rule). This observation is based on my literature review, because the light trapping eﬃciency of theoretical structures signiﬁcantly exceeds that of experimental ones (see Fig. 2.17). To study and to quantify the impact of parasitic eﬀects on the silicon absorption enhancement, I decided to compare two diﬀerent light-trapping mechanisms. In a joint project with CNR-IMM Catania, each research group fabricated their own design on an identical silicon slab. I used a quasi-random diﬀractive structure, which I had etched into the silicon surface, whereas the research group of Catania focused on self-assembled silver nanoparticles as strong scatterers for the incident light. While Mie theory predicts a low parasitic absorption for the metallic particles, this theory neglects that scattered light can come back to the particles and be scattered or absorbed again. I developed a model for the extraction of the parasitic inﬂuence by considering the cumulative parasitics that may arise from many round-trips of trapped light (see section 4.3). My analysis turned out to be robust even for diﬀerent functional dependencies of the parasitic absorption, such that I could generally state that diﬀractive light-trapping structures tend to be a better choice for photovoltaic applications, because of the cumulative parasitics arising from multipath interactions at the metallic nanoparticles. Chapter 5. Conclusions 101 In summary, this thesis outlines the assessment of light-trapping structures, the critical importance of parasitic loss mechanisms and demonstrates a simple layer- transfer technique to enable the study of more eﬃcient light-trapping designs. 5.1.1 Limitations and future work left As the electron beam system I used at York was the ﬁrst ever VOYAGER sys- tem produced by Raith, I often encountered exposure issues during my work. Although receiving outstanding support from the company, the regularly recur- ring software bugs and breakdowns of the pattern exposures slowed the overall lithography process down. Therefore, if I were given a second chance, I probably would have moved on to nanoimprint lithography earlier. For example, time did not allow me to ﬁne-tune the imprint parameters for the replication of structures with simultaneous small and large structural features, such as the quasi-random supercell pattern used in my experiments. Future work thus will need to focus on 1. the inﬂuence of the applied pressure during the UV curing step, 2. the matching of the relief height of the stamp to the resist thickness, 3. the determination of the etching rate of AMONIL, 4. the fabrication of bi-layer hard-PDMS/PDMS stamps, 5. the replacement of the current LEDs with a 360 nm wavelength LED array. In addition, if time had permitted, I would also have tried to drop cast the nanoresist AMONIL directly onto the stamp (instead of the silicon substrate), because it may make the spinning step redundant, could reduce the necessary amount of resist material and even further facilitate the process. This method is known as reverse nanimprint lithography. Secondly, I would have tried to set up a step-and-repeat imprint process in order to prove the scalability of light-trapping patterns on our simple home-made setup described in section A. Chapter 5. Conclusions 102 After the nanolithography process, I used RIE etching to transfer the diﬀrac- tive nanostructures into the silicon material. However, the kinetic ion energies tend to severely damage the material. While surface defects may be irrelevant in terms of the textures optical performance, material defects degrade the electrical performance of a thin-ﬁlm solar cell device. For example, when light trapping structures are made via RIE processes and used in solar cells, the carrier trans- port can be subject to surface recombination velocities as high as 105 cm/s [151]. The need for curing these defects requires eﬃcient surface passivation techniques  solar cells would otherwise not beneﬁt from the absorption enhancement oﬀered by diﬀractive light-trapping structures. However, although eﬃcient surface passivation techniques were recently intro- duced, which allow the curing of defective states, most methods require addi- tional processing steps, reduce the throughput capability and tend to be diﬃcult to integrate into production lines.Why should the combination of nanoimprint- lithography and anisotropic wet etching not be an alternative to reactive ion etching then ? The high damage of crystal planes is avoided (less electrical de- fects), no vacuum equipment is needed (higher throughput and cost-eﬀective), and the optical performance of graded textures has been shown to be advanta- geous for anti-reﬂection and light trapping (see subsection 2.2.2). For these three reasons, I initiated wet-etching tests to explore the feasibility of nanostructuring the silicon surface with tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH). Unfortunately, I had to interrupt these tests, because the mask mate- rials used (ﬂowable oxide, FOx, i.e. spin-on glass; Al and Ni metal layers) turned out to be unsuitable for this purpose. Future work could therefore concentrate to develop this idea further, once one is able to deposit or to grow typical masking materials for silicon, such as silicon nitride or thermal silicon oxide. However, the need for thin crystalline silicon layers for my experiments also motivated me to use TMAH for the etching of a standard silicon wafer down from 500 µm thickness to a slab of tens of microns. Figure 5.1 shows my simple setup for this test along with the resulting outcome. The total etching time may take up to 6 h at temperatures around 200 C. Chapter 5. Conclusions 103 Fig. 5.1: TMAH wet etching allows to thin silicon standard wafers down to a few tens of micrometers. When the sample is left in TMAH at 200 C for 6 hours, the thickness is reduced from 500 to 50 µm  where the material starts to become ﬂexible. It was not until recently when I identiﬁed the master thesis from Erik Janssen [152] as inspiration for optimizing this etching process, because he reviews ﬁve diﬀerent procedures for thinning substrate wafers down to a few microns. In addition, Janssen also constructed an etching apparatus of Teﬂon that can be totally submersed in an etching solution of potassium hydroxide (KOH). If time would have permitted, I would have studied Janssens thesis and optimized the thinning process in light of his suggestions for obtaining a smoother surface roughness, a faster etching rate or to limit the etching attack only to one side of the wafer. The latter may even allow to transfer a high-quality layer of 200 nm crystaline silicon from the silicon substrate of a standard SOI wafer to a glass carrier for handling. Future work also needs to focus on the absorption measurement setup. A better collimation of the laser beam is required on the sample, because the measured Fabry-Perot fringes of unstructured thin-ﬁlms show a reduced dynamic range. In addition, since diﬀracted light from the sample can be directly reﬂected towards the entrance port, I would recommend to use a smaller entrance port of a few mm2 area. Last but not least, this PhD project has been a great experience for me. The developing of theoretical and experimental methods was a comprehensive learning curve in respect of the understanding of light management and of experimental skills in fabrication and characterization of nanostructures. Chapter 5. Conclusions 104 I would deﬁnitely study light trapping again: although the interplay of light and matter is only the ﬁrst step in the photovoltaic conversion mechanisms, it must be well understood in order to pursue power eﬃciencies well above the ShockleyQueisser limit of 30%. The gained knowledge in this research ﬁeld therefore becomes important for tandem solar cells that require an intermediate scatterer between the top and bottom cell, i.e. a selective Lambertian reﬂection of short-wavelength light (top cell) alongside Lambertian transmission of long- wavelength light (bottom cell). Such an arrangement could allow to reduce the absorber thickness of both cells and hence facilitate the collection of photogen- erated charge carriers. 5.1.2 Outlook The next step would be the realization of a working thin-ﬁlm silicon solar cell ( 20 µm) based on the layer-transfer technique and the diﬀractive supercell structure (see chapter 4). Its realization could allow the study of how light- trapping inﬂuences the power conversion eﬃciency, i.e. the electrical perfor- mance. Here, I will brieﬂy outline one possible fabrication process for such a device, using the steps shown in Fig. 5.2: 1. structuring and coating/passivating the front surface (steps 1-4), 2. passivating the back surface (step 5), 3. fabricating the p-type electrode (steps 6-9), 4. fabricating the n-type electrode (steps 10-13), 5. deﬁning the metal contacts (step 14), 6. applying a spacer layer and a white back reﬂector (step 15). Since electrons as the minority-charge carriers are generally able to diﬀuse longer distances in p-doped crystalline silicon than holes in n-doped Si, the absorber layer can be chosen to be doped lightly p-type already. A lightly doped material also reduces the probability of Auger-recombinations. Chapter 5. Conclusions 105 Fig. 5.2: Possible fabrication process for thin-ﬁlm silicon solar cells (see text). In order to avoid unnecessary optical losses, thin-ﬁlm solar cell should use the entire front surface as the active area. Light-trapping structures then can exploit the entire device area at the front, yet both electrical contacts have to be arranged at the back side of the device (in an interdigitated fashion). Before applying the layer transfer technique, the absorber material must ﬁrst be structured (step 1) and be passivated, e.g. via the PECVD deposition of SiNx (step 2), since the foreign glass carrier will not allow the access to the front side any more (step 3). Sunlight, however, is able to pass through the new glass substrate and will be diﬀracted by the coated supercell structure into the silicon absorber. After the transfer (step 4), the thin and heavily doped electrodes are applied to the back side. A thin layer of a-Si:H (ca. 10 nm) acts as the passivation layer for the back side and as a formation layer for the electrodes. Metal masks allow to selectively dry-etch the contact regions (step 6 and 10) prior the evaporation of the electrode materials (step 7 and 11) and the thin conductive oxide layer (step 8 and 12). Subsequent cleaning steps will address shunting issues (step 9 and Chapter 5. Conclusions 106 13) and complete the fabrication of the electrodes. The conductive oxide, here In2O3, and the sputtered SiOx (step 15) optically act as a cladding layer for the absorber layer and aim to enhance the total internal reﬂection of light. The sputtering of the metal contacts (step 14) and the coating/spray deposition of a white back reﬂector (step 15) will ﬁnalize the fabrication process. 5.2 Can solar power solve the worlds energy crisis ? Two important issues I did not address in this thesis so far. First, solar power will only become truly competitive, if the storage problem can be overcome. Once this additional hurdle is solved, I think solar energy can make a signiﬁcant contribution towards the worlds energy production. Second, transport problems can be an issue, because low-latitude countries receive the most hours of bright sunshine during the year, whereas mid- to high-latitude countries have the highest per capita energy consumption. However, I would like to ﬁnish my thesis with a few more general thoughts about our research eﬀorts for a more eﬃcient energy technology. In short, I am asking the question whether the worlds energy crisis can be solved by technologies based on solar power. Energy drives economies, guarantees growth and sustains the existence of billions of people. While human population quadrupled in the last century, our energy consumption increased tenfold in the same period. Some studies even see the in- crease in population as a consequence of the higher energy consumption, because new technologies have allowed farmers to cultivate increasingly larger ﬁelds and to generate greater crop yields. In light of this statement, a 10% growth of human population would be based on a 50% greater thermal coal consumption. In fact, China, the country with the fastest growing population, is the largest energy consumer and the worlds largest coal producer as well as importer, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). Chapter 5. Conclusions 107 In the end, the fast transitions from the agricultural to the digital age have made our living costs more and more energy-intensive. The continuing population growth might cease when either the energy supply or the space on our planet fails to keep up with our demand for natural capital. If the required space takes into account the amount of biologically productive land and sea area  not only necessary to supply the resources a human population consumes, but also to assimilate associated waste and pollution , one can deﬁne the footprint of human population by its impact on Earths biocapacity. The global ecological footprint is a standardized ﬁgure-of-merit of our demand on the Earths ecosystems. For example, a footprint of 1 would mean that humanity uses ecological services as quickly as Earth can renew them. The majority of environmental studies, however, agree that we already need a biocapacity greater than our planet to meet our standards of living; we are living too energy intensive: fossil fuels, like coal and petroleum, are identiﬁed as the leading causes for our large footprint, but still remain rooted as the response to our rapidly increasing energy demands  even at much higher spot prices and progressively poorer quality (see Fig. 5.3). Ultimately, our strong dependence on fuels has resulted in many political, social and ethical conﬂicts. I believe these global conﬂicts will further increase if fossil fuels remain rooted in our society. Consequently, we may are not limited by energy, but by space in support of human sustainability. The focus recently moved to green technologies, that are able to replace the usage of coal and petroleum. In particular, solar power experiences a remark- able revolution, demonstrating new capacities at record installation rates. The enormous potential of solar energy is one of the motivating forces, that drives the new ambitions. England, for example, receives 2.4 kWh/m2 on an average day from sun. Therefore, the sunshine on a London cab can already meet the electricity needs per capita (8 kWh/day), whereas the sunlight over all England even exceeds worlds electricity demands by six times. Chapter 5. Conclusions 108 Ironically and despite all the eﬀorts over the last decades, solar power contributes to our net electricity by less than 0.2 %  coal still by over 40 %. The promotion of a green technology may be a challenging task, but its success will probably not solve our hedonism on energy: yes, solar power allows to reduce the ecolog- ical footprint and so can facilitate humanitys sustainability, but no, I think, it probably will not satisfy the worlds screams for energy. Fig. 5.3: The global ecological footprint is a standardized measure for the human impact on Earths biocapacity. While in the last decade population and the global footprint grew at almost the same rate, the energy requirements disproportionally increased at much higher costs. Here, the spot prices of the West Texas Intermediate (WTI), of the central Appalachian coal (CAPP) and of the Australian thermal coal (AP) were used in the analysis (see text). Appendices A A home-made UV nanoimprint tool In light of the issues mentioned in subsection 3.2.2, I decided to set up a UV nanoimprint tool, because the technical requirements are less demanding accord- ing to Tab. 3.1 on page 64. I decided to use GaN-based LEDs at the required wavelength of 400 nm, they are much cheaper than a conventional UV lamp, they last longer and they do not need to warm up for stability. A.1 Technical requirements Three basic elements conform to the technical requirements of the process ﬂow diagram shown in Fig. A.1. Fig. A.1: As the tool is intended for a single exposure only, with no align- ment requirements, the stamp and the resist coated substrate are brought into contact by eye. A transparent stage allows mould (stamp) and polymer layer (resist) to be exposed to UV light from the bottom. GaN-based LEDs (400 nm wavelength) are integrated into the underpart of the tool, while, at the same time, the arrangement is permitting the application of low pressure to the materials by a weight from the top. Following exposure, the sample and stamp remain bound together and must be prised apart, which ﬁnishes the nanoimprint process. 109 Appendices 110 Firstly, a stage is required on the tool for the location of the specimen. The stage has to be transparent to the UV radiation used for curing. Secondly, UV lights needs to cure the resist material. Thirdly, pressure must be applied to the stamp/resist sandwich during the curing process. The silicon sample must therefore be placed onto a transparent stamp, because pressure can then simply be applied by a weight from the top. Otherwise, extra arrangements would be required for keeping the pressure constant during UV exposure. Since the LED-array has an emission cone of about 140, I used an aluminum- tunnel of 3 inch diameter in order to funnel the light from the source towards the sample. The Fig. A.2 shows a photograph of the tool. Note that most of the components (LED-array, heat-sink and quartz-disk) were acquired form ebay at a total cost of  100 US$, with some additional help form the mechanical workshop at York. Fig. A.2: The home-made nanoimprint setup is an assembly of a UV-SLED array, a heat sink and a quartz disk (3 inch in diameter). The left and right photograph display the tool from the side and the top, respectively. A 50 pence coin is also shown as a size reference. The light tunnel is made of a glass tube with aluminium evaporated on the inside surface in order to direct the diﬀusive light from the SLED array towards the quartz disk. The electrical and optical characteristics of the setup are listed in Tab. A.1. Appendices 111 A.2 Technical speciﬁcations of the UV tool The speciﬁcations of the home-made UV nanoimprint tool are summarized in Tab. A.1; the optical characteristics were measured in the department. Using three diﬀerent methods, i.e. a PIN diode, a power meter and a spectrum analyzer, I could accurately determine the optical output power shown in the right hand side of Tab. A.1. At the sample plane, I noticed that the illumination is not uniform, and drops from 28 mW/cm2 at the center towards 14 mW/cm2 at the border. The struc- tured region of the template, however, is always less than 1 cm2, such that the imprint process remains unaﬀected by the non-uniformity if the structured area is placed in the central part of the quartz-disk. In addition, the radiance on the quartz-disk is less than 30 mJ/cm2 per second, which is very low compared to the typical curing dose of 1 J/cm2 according to Tab. 3.1. Therefore, the non- uniformity does not result in internal stress in the nanoresist (see page 65) even for larger structured areas. Forward Voltage: 27 30.6 V Forward Current: 350 mA Input power: 10 W Central wavelength: 395 400 nm Intensity on disk: 1428 mW/cm2 Luminous Flux: 20 LM Optical power: 1.45 W Tab. A.1: Speciﬁcations of the LED array used in the homemade UV nanoim- print tool. The electrical data were taken from the datasheet, the optical char- acteristics were accurately measured in the department. The intensity on the 3 inch quartz disk drops from 100% at the center towards 50% at the border, c.f. Fig. A.2. Appendices 112 A.3 Testing the tool by photo lithography In order to verify the operation of the tool, I conducted two tests: 1. Shipley Microposit S1813 requires an exposure dose of 140 mJ/cm2. The resist is optimised for 436 nm (g-line), which is close to the emission from the LED array. An exposure time of 7 seconds was suﬃcient to expose the resist, which corresponds to an eﬀective intensity of 20 mW/cm2, and hence within the measured range. 2. Norland Optical Adhesive NOA61 requires an exposure dose of 3 J/cm2, which is 20 times higher than for S1813. I therefore tried to glue two microscope slides together and used a 3 minute exposure time for curing. Both trials were successful, despite the fact that the exposure properties of S1813 and NOA61 are optimized for use at 436 nm (g-line) and 365 nm (i-line), respec- tively. Therefore, the curing wavelengths will refer to recommendations, as the materials must have a far broader UV sensitivity. A.4 The stamp materials The stamp is a central part of the imprint process, because it must retain and consistently replicate the same structures many times. The materials used for the fabrication of stamps have to meet the following criteria: 1. Stamps have to be transparent to UV light. 2. Stamps must be chemically compatible with the resist material: a stamp should not get swollen by the liquid resist, which could aﬀect the pattern proﬁle or duration of the stamp, or be penetrable for oxygen, which may impede the solidiﬁcation process of the resist. 3. The easy detachment of a stamp from a hardened polymer layer needs to be guaranteed to prevent pattern damages (caused by a rip-oﬀ) and contamination (caused by sticky residues). Appendices 113 4. Ideally, a stamp would conform to any waviness of the substrate. While small air bubbles, trapped in the cavities of the stamp, will likely dissolve in the resist material, larger air bubbles may remain and signiﬁcantly aﬀect the imprint result. In addition, the inclusion of particles between stamp and resist must be elimi- nated, since these will distort the imprinted replica. Microscope glass slides comply with criteria (1) and (2), and the treatment of a patterned glass-surface with ﬂuorinated silane groups [123] could also address requirement (3). However, e-beam lithography on non-conducting oxides is gen- erally complicated by the poor charge dissipation and need for high resolution. While the former obliges a high clearing dose ( 700 µC/cm2), the latter pro- hibits the usage of a large aperture. Correspondingly, exposures could become too time-intensive. Since the etching of nanostructures into glass would further- more require a parameter study on the RIE, I chose to focus on stamp materials that oﬀer a faster turnaround time from design to pattern. I had to try two approaches to ﬁnd out the one that worked: a) Instead of using the glass directly, it serves as a substrate for spin-coating the stamp material that can fulﬁl the criteria (1-4). b) Using a ﬂexible material such as poly(dimethyl)siloxane (PDMS). For the ﬁrst approach (a), which turned out to fail, I used the Fluorolink products MD500 and MD700 from Solvay Solexis [153]. MD500 is a UV curable polyether, which acts as the transparent ﬂuorinated cast (1), whereas MD700 is applied as a primer, providing mechanical strength and a strong adhesion of MD500 to the glass substrate (3). The Fluorolink products then only had to be tested against criteria (2), i.e. the chemical compatibility between the stamp and the resist. The compatibility test, however, failed with the available resist (Microresist UV- Cur21), because the stamp material MD500 is permeable to oxygen, inhibiting the resists solidiﬁcation. Appendices 114 For the second approach (b), which turned out to work, PDMS is ﬁrst cast and cured against a template. Such rubber-elastic stamps not only conform to any waviness of the substrate (4); if the PDMS stamp is placed in contact with a liquid resist, capillary forces tend to pull the stamp into the resist, thereby minimizing the possibility of eventual structural deformations during the UV curing process. While PDMS is transparent and therefore complies with criterion (1), the swelling of PDMS in resist solutions may aﬀect the durability of the stamp and could violate criterion (2), i.e. the chemical compatibility between the stamp and the resist. However, this compatibility issue was solved by the German company AMO that developed a UV nanoresist material (AMONIL) especially for PDMS stamps. In addition, Odom et al. [154] introduced an imprinting method based on a composite bi-layer stamp of hard-PDMS/PDMS. A thin layer of hard-PDMS enables imprint capabilities down to the 20 nm range [155], while the thick PDMS layer ensures the global ﬂexibility by its lower Young modulus. The bi-layer stamp method therefore ensures the easy detachment from the cured resist, i.e. criterion (3). Hamouda et al. [156] could even prove the externally applied pressure to be dispensable, which relaxes the technical requirements for the UV curing process. Using a composite bi-layer stamp of hard-PDMS/PDMS and the nanoresist AMONIL (MMS4), mentioned above, I was able to successfully imprint silicon substrates, which will be outlined in more detail next. Appendices 115 A.5 Testing the tool by nanoimprint lithography The nanoimprint process is conducted with a composite bi-layer stamp of hard- PDMS/PDMS, the resist AMONIL (MMS4) from AMO and a silicon substrate. The successful process is illustrated in Fig. A.3 and consists of three basic steps: a) In order to facilitate the peeling oﬀand to ensure no deformations of the imprinted nanostructures, the PDMS stamp is treated with a ﬂuorinated silane group, which acts similarly as a Teﬂon coating [123]. b) Since the resist will be used as a mask to transfer the imprinted pattern into a silicon substrate by etching, a 200 nm thick layer of AMONIL (MMS4) resist is spin-coated onto a silicon substrate. As an additional precaution against the peel-oﬀissue, I also brieﬂy apply a gentle oxygen plasma to the silicon surface just before spinning the resist; this treatment mediates a strong binding between silicon and resist. c) The next step is the contact with the stamp, because AMONIL does not require a baking step in between the spinning and the UV curing process. After locating the stamp in the central part of the quartz disk of the UV tool, the silicon sample is carefully placed on top of the stamp with the resist coated side facing downwards. A gentle press  followed by the positioning of a small weight (100 g) on the back side of the silicon substrate  ﬁnishes the merging process of stamp and resist layer. Fig. A.3: a) A compositite bi-layer stamp of hard-PDMS/PDMS is made hydrophobic by deposition of a silane layer, which acts similarly as a Teﬂon coating and therefore eﬀectively addresses the peel-oﬀissue. b) A thin-layer of AMONIL resist is afterwards spin-coated onto a silicon substrate. The resist may later be used as a mask to transfer the imprinted pattern into the silicon by etching. c) AMONIL is gently pressed into the PDMS stamp and then cured under UV light. Appendices 116 The UV light exposure completes the nanoimprint process. However, while the LEDs emit UV light at 400 nm wavelength, AMONIL is designed for UV-curing at 320 nm and requires an exposure dose of 2, 000 mJ/cm2. If I simply calculate the overlap integral between the light source (see Tab. A.1) and the sensitivity curve of AMONIL (taken from the datasheet), I ﬁnd a correction factor of 20. Therefore, the required exposure time extends to 2,000 mJ/1.5 mW 20 min on my tool. Since applying higher doses or broader UV-wavelength ranges would neither aﬀect the imprint quality nor the properties of the cured polymer ac- cording to the manufacturer, the AMONIL is instead exposed for 30 minutes as a precautionary measure. After exposure, the silicon substrate and PDMS stamp will remain stuck to- gether, but they can easily be separated from each other by manually peeling the ﬂexible PDMS stamp from the silicon sample. Figure A.4a shows the outcome of the nanoimprint lithography process. Fig. A.4: The ﬁrst results of the UV home-made nanoimprint tool presented in Fig. A.2. The above pictures show a Si photonic crystal with period 600 nm (a) right after the demoulding step and (b) after RIE etching. The nanoresist AMONIL exhibits good masking properties. Picture (c) shows the imprinted sample from diﬀerent angles to highlight the diﬀractive properties of the pho- tonic structure. Appendices 117 The ﬁnal step is the transfer of the pattern into the silicon substrate. The sample is therefore etched for 1 minute via RIE, then cleaned in a fresh prepared piranha solution (H2SO4:H2O2 = 3:1) and again inspected (see Fig. A.4b). AMONIL tends to exhibit good masking properties, because the test structure was suc- cessfully transferred from the resist into the silicon substrate. In conclusion, the tool can be used for UV nanoimprint lithography. Using com- posite bi-layer stamps of hard-PDMS/PDMS along with the nanoresist AMONIL allows the fabrication of nanostructures in silicon. The tool also allowed me to structure the surface of unpolished silicon substrates with 160 µm thickness. A.6 Concluding remarks Many requirements are set to UV nanoresists as spin-on solutions; a composition of functional compounds and monomer mixtures is not only ﬁne-tuned to yield a special combination of chemical/physical properties before and after photoini- tiation, the components themselves must also be chemical compatible with each other. Table A.2 overviews the key requisites for a UV nanoresist. All listed criteria are met by the AMONIL resist from AMO in combination with a composite bi-layer stamp of hard-PDMS/PDMS. before photoinitiation after photoinitiation liquid spin-on solution adhesive to the substrate adequate thickness range tensile strength low exposure dose integrity of patterns coating with capillary action anti-sticking to the stamp insensitivity to oxygen inhibition etching resistance Tab. A.2: Many chemical and physical properties must be met by a UV nanoresist before (left column) as well as after photoinitiation (right column), while its chemical components have to be compatible with each other at the same time. Since the combination of these properties tends to be diﬃcult to meet, suitable nanoresists tend to be expensive, e.g. AMONIL 6e/ml. Appendices 118 B Absorption measurement setup In order to characterise my samples, I built a bespoke setup. The following subsection B.1 provides detailed background information about this setup. B.1 Design considerations For accurate absorption measurements, the total reﬂection R and total transmis- sion T of a sample should be determined at the same time. However, standard spectrophotometers only allow to measure R and T one after the other and by repositioning the sample. When the spectra are obtained in sequence, the mea- surements could diﬀer either in the angle of incidence or in the illuminated area of the sample, and therefore resulting in artefacts and inaccurate data sets, e.g. the absorption exceeds 1 or falls below 0. In order to avoid such artefacts, I modiﬁed a standard integrating sphere such that R and T are detected simultaneously. B.1.1 The integrating sphere Integrating spheres are designed to spatially increase the net radiant ﬂux by multiple reﬂections inside. The higher the sphere surface reﬂectance (here Lam- bertian Spectraﬂect coating) and the smaller the port fraction, the greater the radiance. The radiance is typically enhanced by 10 to 30 times in a sphere with respect to a planar diﬀuser of the same surface area [157], yet decreases with larger diameters. Since the sample is mounted in the center of the sphere, the arrangement as such will aﬀect the overall throughput of the integrating sphere (see Fig. B.1). The change in sphere throughput  caused by mounting the sample in the center of the sphere  is known as substitution error and is due to specular reﬂections between the sample and the light in the sphere, even after the beams ﬁrst strike on the sample [158]. However, this error can be corrected, if neither the sample is too large nor the sphere diameter too small. Appendices 119 Regarding the choice of integrating sphere, there is a trade-oﬀbetween a small substitution error (requires a large sphere diameter) and a high radiance (requires a small sphere diameter). According to the E903 international standard of the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM), the specimen area should be limited to 1% of the surface area of the sphere. While this choice was not made clear in the ASTM guidelines, the deﬁnition closely corresponds to the typical port fraction. The substitution error can then be understood as if a substitutional radiance loss was caused by an additional port on the sphere. Since my samples are no larger than 2 cm2, this recommendation suggests a diameter of at least 8 cm. I therefore opted for a 4 inch integrating sphere (10 cm diameter). While a 2 inch sphere would have been too small, a 6 inch system would yield a lower radiant ﬂux at the detector port. Fig. B.1: Integrating spheres are designed to spatially increase the incident radiant ﬂux Φin by multiple reﬂections inside the sphere. For absorption mea- surements, the test sample is mounted in the center, such that both the total reﬂection and total transmission are detected simultaneously (a). However, the light in the sphere can interact with the area of the specimen Asample, even after the beams ﬁrst strike on the sample, and hence signiﬁcantly change the optical ﬂux at the detector port. If the area of the sample Asample is much smaller than the area of the sphere Asphere, i.e. Asample 0.01  Asphere, these interactions can be corrected by taking a reference spectrum. The sample must therefore be kept out of the direct line of sight, as indicated in (b). A baﬄe further prevents any direct irradiation of the detector and ensures a hemispherical ﬁeld-of-view. Appendices 120 In order to minimise artefacts while achieving a high throughput, the require- ments on the integrating sphere are therefore: 1. 8-10 cm diameter size 2. Integration of a center mount sample holder 3. Introduction of a chalk baﬄe in front of the detector to prevent any direct irradiation 4. Reduction of the port fraction by minimizing the size of the entrance port 5. Mounting the photodetector directly onto a port reducer B.1.2 The monochromator Light-trapping, anti-reﬂection action and in-coupling of photons are wavelength dependent mechanisms. Light-trapping by diﬀraction particularly relies on the interaction between the light waves and the topographical surface features. There- fore, useful absorption measurements require the performance of spectrographs with nm-resolution. I will discuss two options for the setup: 1. A CCD spectrometer, which is able to detect the incident light intensity versus wavelength at the detector port. 2. A monochromator, which is able to transmit a tuneable narrow band of wavelengths to the entrance port. The ﬁrst option, which I decided not to use, is to spectrally analyse the output light with a spectrometer. The USB4000 from Ocean Optics oﬀers an elegant solution, as it uses a linear CCD array for the spectral analysis and features a wavelength resolution of λ = 1.4 nm. However, the small pixels of the detector (8  20 µm2) may be too small for our application, given the low radiant ﬂux inside the sphere and the diﬀuse light conditions; the USB4000, like any grating spectrometer, requires a collimated input light beam. In addition, the spectral sensitivity of the CCD sensor is also markedly blue-shifted with respect to a standard silicon photodiode, which may limit the detection of near-infrared light, as shown in Fig. B.2. Appendices 121 Fig. B.2: Spectral sensitivity of the linear CCD array used in the USB4000 (blue curve) diﬀers from a standard photoreceiver PDA100 (red curve) by a considerable blue shift, even when the same material is used. The optical eﬀect of MOS-capacitors and passivating coating-layers on a CCD chip tends to inﬂuence the spectral response. In contrast, the spectral dependency of standard photodiodes is mainly determined by the absorption coeﬃcient of the bulk material, because of the general absence of electronic surface structures on the active area. The second option, which I opted for, is to spectrally select the input light with a grating monochromator and to combine this with a very sensitive detector on the output side; the detector does not require collimated light, so is more suited to operating with an integrating sphere. The advantages of monochromators are the sub-nm optical resolution, due to focal lengths far greater than 100 mm, and the possibility of analyzing multiple spectral ranges, as usually more than one grating can be used. Even if the monochromator increases the complexity of the setup, the apparatus adds a valuable degree of ﬂexibility to the experiment. I operated the apparatus as a tunable light source together with a SM-30 supercontinuum white light source from LEUKOS. The spectrum of the SM-30 is shown in Fig. B.3. For silicon absorption measurements, the monochromator needs to perform best from the UV to the silicon bandgap. Consequently, the required diﬀraction grating must cover the 4001100 nm range and be blazed in the visible spectrum. Blazing means that the grating allows to concentrate a large percentage of the incident energy into a speciﬁc diﬀraction order. In order to avoid overlap between diﬀerent diﬀracted orders of the grating, the selected wavelength is reﬂected to the exit slit as the ﬁrst diﬀraction order, while Appendices 122 a longpass ﬁlter is inserted in the optical path for limiting the width of other diﬀraction orders. Scanning a spectrum is then accomplished by rotating the grating with a motor. I chose the diﬀraction grating from Richardson Optics shown in Fig. B.4, as it has a high diﬀraction eﬃciency over a broad spectral range. Fig. B.3: The SM-30 supercontinuum white light laser source from LEUKOS uses the non-linear eﬀects of a photonic crystal ﬁber to generate a broadband spectrum. The seed repetition rate is 30 kHz at the pump 1064 nm wavelength of a Nd:YAG laser (1 ns pulse width), hence the apparent spike at 1,064 nm. Fig. B.4: Eﬃciency curves for the reﬂection grating from Richardson Op- tics. The graphs are taken from the speciﬁcation sheet and normalized to the reﬂection of aluminium. As the grating is optimized for silicon absorption measurements, it was installed in the monochromator Omniλ-150 from Gilden Photonics in an astigmatism-corrected Czerny-Turner design. The blazing wavelength is at 500 nm, and the gratings period of 833 nm corresponds to a groove density of 1200 grooves/mm. Appendices 123 B.1.3 The detectors For measuring the intensity of the diﬀuse light in the sphere, a photo-detector needs to be mounted at the spheres detector port (see Fig. B.1). Since the setup has to characterize the absorption of (structured) silicon samples, a high sensitivity is required in the NIR spectral region, where silicon is only weakly absorbing. In the following, the requirements of the detector are analyzed in terms of bandwidth, sensitivity, performance and suitability. Detector bandwidth The scanning motor of the monochromator samples A(λ) at intervals of λ = 1 nm. The sampling rate fs is given by the grating motor, which is limited to a maximum speed of 7 Hz, hence the detector band- width does not need to exceed 2 fs = 14 Hz, according to the sampling theorem. A low bandwidth also means that the 30 kHz pulse repetition rate of the laser is not resolved (as required) and the detector reads out a constant DC signal. While the absorption of a sample (mounted in the center of the sphere) is derived by the signal of the detector that is directly attached to the sphere, ﬂuctuations of the laser light, occurring during the measurements, are taken into account by a second detector outside the sphere. The arrangement of the detectors is schematically shown in Fig. B.5. Fig. B.5: The signal detector (highlighted in red) records the radiance inside the sphere and is directly attached via a port reducer. Any ﬂuctuations of the laser light are taken into account by a reference detector (highlighted in black) outside the sphere. Since the monochromator acts like a gate for the selected wavelength, the sampling rate is deﬁned by the speed of the stepping motor and not by the bandwidth of the detectors. Appendices 124 Sensitivity The sensitivity of a photodetector is related to the signal-to-noise power ratio S/N. The noise equivalent power contained in a 1 Hz bandwidth is quantiﬁed by NEP  RMS noise voltage (V/  1 Hz) spectral responsivity (A/W)  transimpedance gain (V/A). (1) The spectral responsivity is typically in the order of 0.5 A/W; if the RMS noise voltage of the detector is above 2.5 mV/  Hz, a gain of 1012 V/A is required to obtain a NEP of 5 fW/  Hz. As the bandwidth does not need to exceed 14 Hz (see section B.1.3), the detector is used in photovoltaic mode, i.e. without externally applied bias, because of reduced dark current and higher linearity at low light levels, which are not as good when a reverse bias is applied (see Fig. B.6). The minimum power Pmin required for a S/N = 1 is then Pmin = NEP  p fd with fd 14 Hz. (2) For example, if the NEP of a detector is 5 fW/  Hz at 2 eV (620 nm wavelength), Pmin = 18.7 fW in a bandwidth of 14 Hz, i.e. more than 4200 photons are required to obtain a S/N  1 (4200  14 Hz  2 eV 18.8 fW). In order to compare various detectors and to understand their performances, the NEP is normalized to the square root of the active area A. The resulting quantity is commonly referred to as the sensitivity, or speciﬁc detectivity D, of a photodetector: D  A NEP = A fd Pmin = S/N = D Pin A  fd (3) The sensitivity is measured in Jones [cm  Hz/W] and is the most useful param- eter for the purpose of comparison, because Dis independent of the area or operating frequency. Appendices 125 Fig. B.6: When photodetectors are operated in the photovoltaic mode, the pn-diode remains zero biased. As the open-circuit voltage depends on the in- cident light intensity Φin logarithmically, the photodiode is virtually shorted to the ground of an operational ampliﬁer and therefore used as a current gen- erator instead. A large feedback resistor then serves as a (negative) feedback response to the photodiode, implying a high ampliﬁer gain, yet a slow voltage response Vout. However, the operation is extremely linear at low light levels due to the almost complete elimination of leakage currents. A diﬀerent ﬁgure-of-merit is often cited as the gain-bandwidth product (GBP), because both a high gain and a high cut-oﬀfrequency are advantageous. However, since the noise power Pmin scales with the operating bandwidth fd according to Eq. 2, transimpedance ampliﬁers are speciﬁcally designed for the operation at low frequencies (small bandwidth) with very large feedback resistors (high gain). Four noise sources are mainly encountered in connection with photodetectors: 1. Johnson noise. Johnson noise results from the random motion of electrons in a conductor and is the dominant contribution to the overall noise ﬁgure if a large feedback resistor is used in the photovoltaic mode of operation. Johnson noise has a white noise spectrum (a ﬂat frequency power spec- trum). 2. Shot noise. Shot noise, or dark current noise, results from the random generation and recombination of charge carriers within the depletion region in the absence of an external signal. Shot noise provides the greatest noise contribution in the photoconductive mode of operation, because it scales with the reverse bias. Appendices 126 3. Photon noise. The nature of the signal itself may lead to appreciable changes in the photocurrent: photon noise, also known as Poisson noise, refers to the inherent variation of the incident photon ﬂux and, therefore, imposes a fundamental noise limit to a photodetector. One way to reduce this kind of noise is by increasing the signal level, which usually means longer integration times. 4. 1/f noise. While the mechanisms that produce 1/f noise are poorly un- derstood, it is often related to the DC level and to imperfections in the semiconductor. 1/f noise is a typical noise ﬁgure of transistors and consid- ered to be correlated with an ineﬃcient charge transfer of the channels. In presence of 1/f noise, longer integration times do not improve the S/N and possibly saturate the pixel. 1/f noise has a pink noise spectrum, i.e. every octave contains the same amount of noise power. In addition, if the setup is not suﬃciently screened, background signals can inﬂu- ence the noise ﬂoor of the detector. For example, external noise sources created by electrical devices tend to occur at the power line frequency or any harmonic of it. It is therefore a common practice to avoid sampling frequencies that are equal to an integer number of power line cycles (NPLC). Optical powers down to the sub-femtowatt regime, however, are generally only detectable in combination with a phase-sensitive device, e.g. a lock-in ampliﬁer. The lock-in ampliﬁer is able to sample a small AC signal while ignoring noise signals at other frequencies. Using a lock-in therefore requires to periodically interrupt a continuous signal, e.g. a light source by a chopper. The modulation allows to choose an operating frequency where any interfering signals are small- est. I decided not to use a lock-in ampliﬁer, because a lock-in typically operates at several 100 Hz, which is higher than the required bandwidth of the detector. In addition, if the voltage across the diode is (virtual) zero, the dark current is min- imized, thus the noise at the ampliﬁer input remains almost constant over time, and hence the 1/f noise is reduced signiﬁcantly in the photovoltaic mode of oper- ation. For low DC currents, the thermal noise in the large feedback resistor will therefore provide the greatest contribution to the overall noise ﬁgure. However, Appendices 127 the S/N then can always be increased by a slower sampling rate fs and longer integration time 1/fd. At low light levels, it is better to minimize external noise sources and to choose a detector with a small bandwidth and low NEP, than to extract the signal from the noise after its detection. B.2 Critical assessment In summary, the combination of detector and spectrum analyzer into a single package as in the USB4000 is not advantageous for the detection of weak and diﬀusive light. The separation of dispersion and detection into two specialised units increases the resolution, sensitivity and ﬂexibility of the experiment. The setup can easily be extended for accurate measurements of quantum eﬃciencies. The requirements for the detector now are: 1. bandwidth of less than 20 Hz, 2. gain in the order of 1012 V/A, 3. high responsivity in the NIR spectral region ( 0.5 A/W), 4. active area adapted to the spheres detector port ( 25 mm2), 5. low NEP ( 5 fW/  Hz). Silicon photo-detectors are sensitive to light from the UV to the NIR spectral region (350 nm to 1100 nm), as already shown in Fig. B.2. Thorlabs oﬀers various models with active areas between 1 and 75 mm2, peak responsivities around 970 nm wavelength and gain ﬁgures from 103 up to 1012. The silicon detector PDF10A by Thorlabs fulﬁlls all the above listed requirements and was therefore directly attached to the integrating sphere. The reference detector PDA100 is used outside the sphere to monitor any intensity ﬂuctuations of the laser beam. The speciﬁcations of the detectors are listed in Tab. B.1 and their performance compared to the USB4000 spectrometer in Tab. B.2. By comparing the key parameters listed in Tab. B.2, the high gain and sensitivity of the PDF10A together with two Keithly digital multimeters (DMM) present the best option. Figure B.7 shows a photograph of the ﬁnal measurement setup. Appendices 128 Reference detector Signal detector Model: PDA100A PDF10A Active area: 100 mm2 1.2 mm2 Rise time: 233 ns 22 ms Bandwidth: 0.6 2.4 MHz 20 Hz Ampl.

B.1: Spectral response of the two Si photodetectors that are used in the absorption measurement setup. The red solid line refers to the PDF10A detector (signal detector), which is directly attached to the sphere, whereas the black solid line refers to the PDA100 detector (reference detector), which is positioned outside the sphere, c.f. Fig. B.5. The spectral response curves are typical for silicon, with the peak position being deﬁned by the thickness of the silicon absorber layer. The measured responsivities are compared to an ideal photodiode with a direct electrical bandgap of 1.12 eV (blue dotted line). As the ideal photodiode has a wavelength independent (external) quantum ef- ﬁciency of 100%, reﬂection losses and recombination losses of photo-generated charge carriers are the main reason for the slightly lower responsivities of the high-quality photodetectors. Appendices 129 Detector name USB4000 PDA100 PDF10A Gain (dB) 160 50 100 240 Bandwidth (Hz) 130 6 k 2.4 M 20 GB-Product (Hz) 10 G 600 M 20 T NEP (W/  Hz) 3.5 p 1 30 p 1.4 f A (mm2 / pixel) 1.6  104 100 1.2 D(Jones) 360 M 30 G 1 T 70 T Tab. B.2: The parameters as listed are taken or calculated from the datasheets. The PDA100A has switchable gain, allowing to adapt its sen- sitivity to the light conditions. The USB4000 diﬀers from the PDx detectors by the CCD sensor used for the data acquisition: the read-out time of all data from the CCD restricts the integration time between 3.8 ms and 10 s. The bandwidth can be increased up to 100 kHz by balancing the loss in gain via signal averaging. The low detectivity is mainly due to the pixel size, such that a higher detectivity would necessarily involve a loss in optical resolution or spectral range. The high gain and sensitivity of the PDF10A make the detector suitable for the measurement of small light intensity changes in the integrating sphere (as required). Fig. B.7: The absorption measurement setup is covered in a carton box to minimize the background noise level. The exit slit of the monochromator can be adjusted for the required optical resolution. The detector is directly attached to the integrating sphere, while a reference detector monitors the optical power of the laser beam. All data acquisitions are synchronized by a LabView program with a user interface. Appendices 130 B.3 Data acquisition  speed and accuracy Based on the settling time of the detector (25 ms), the Keithley digital mul- timeter (DMM2110) can integrate the DC signal in 2 s, 200 ms, 40 ms and faster time intervals. I aimed to maximize the integration period of the A/D converter at the Nyquist rate 2 fs in order to reduce the noise from the number of power line cycles (NPLC). Once fs is speciﬁed, the following Tab. B.3 lists the optimal conﬁgurations along with the total acquisition times. grating motor fs : 7 Hz 5 Hz 2.5 Hz 1 Hz 0.25 Hz detector bandwidth fd : 14 Hz 10 Hz 5 Hz 2 Hz 0.5 Hz ADC rate (NPLC): 2 2 10 10 100 total time (650 nm window): 1.5 min 2.2 min 4.3 min 10.8 min 43.3 min Tab. B.3: Optimal parameter settings for the measurement of A(λ) in 1 nm steps. The digital multimeter allows me to measure the detector signal with a resolution of 0.1 mV over a 10 V range. If the number of power line cycles (NPLC) is 10, each read-out is taken as the average of a 200 ms integration time with an accuracy between  0.2 mV (S/N = 1) and  1.4 mV at CW saturation level (S/N=1500). B.4 Measurement limitations Since the settling time is far less than a sampling time interval 1/fs, A(λ) can always be measured at the Nyquist rate, such that the noise of the detector is be reduced to the absolute minimum. In fact, the high sensitivity of the sensor required me to cover the setup with a carton box even in a completely dark room to avoid background noise. The accuracy of the digital multimeter (DMM) corresponds to an intensity change of 5.2 fW in a 14 Hz bandwidth. Hence, provided the incident power is above Pmin, such small changes in A(λ) should be possible to detect. The detector voltage Vout depends linearly on the incident power Pin and is given by Vout(λ) =  1012 V A  R(λ)   Pin(λ). (4) Appendices 131 where R is the wavelength dependent spectral responsivity of the detector and 1012 V A the gain of the ampliﬁer. If I assume a 40 dB intensity reduction of the white light source due to the coupling to the monochromator, the attenuation by optical lenses, polarizer, beam splitter, iris diaphragm and diﬀuse integrating sphere  roughly estimating that each component leads to an intensity drop of 50% , the detector would almost saturate for a transparent sample, following Eq. 4: P max in = 0.56  30 µW / Asphere 15 pW / Adetector  Vout(960 nm) = 9 V Adetector and Asphere 30,000Adetector represent the surface of the active area of the detector and the integrating sphere, whereas the white light source intensity 30 µW/nm and detectors responsivity 0.6 A/W at 960 nm wavelength are taken from Fig. B.3 and Tab. B.1, respectively. If I assume the sample not to be transparent but 99% absorbing, the previous 40 dB intensity reduction would drop to almost 80 dB (0.01  0.56 104). How- ever, the signal would still remain above the detection limit of 6 mV: P min in = 104  20 µW / Asphere 70 fW / Adetector  Vout(400 nm) = 15 mV These assumption were indeed reasonably well veriﬁed in the measurements. In conclusion, the PDF10A fulﬁls all requirements of accurate absorption mea- surements and allows us to characterise A(λ) over a broad spectral range within a total acquisition time of less than 2 minutes at sub-nm optical resolution.
