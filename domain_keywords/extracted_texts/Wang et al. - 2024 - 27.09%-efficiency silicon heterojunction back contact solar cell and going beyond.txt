In this study, we produced highly efﬁcient heterojunction back contact solar cells with a certiﬁed efﬁciency of 27.09% using a laser patterning tech- nique. Our ﬁndings indicate that recombination losses primarily arise from the hole-selective contact region and polarity boundaries. We propose solutions to these issues and establish a clear relationship between contact resistivity, series resistance, and the design of the rear-side pattern. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the wafer edge becomes the main channel for current den- sity loss caused by carrier recombination once electrical shading around the electron-selective contact region is mitigated. With the advanced nanocrys- talline passivating contact, wafer edge passivation technologies and meticu- lous optimization of front anti-reﬂection coating and rear reﬂector, achieving efﬁciencies as high as 27.7% is feasible. The advancement of wafer-based crystalline-silicon (c-Si) solar cells has substantially reduced the levelized cost of energy in photovoltaic (PV) power generation, enabling cost-effective decarbonization. Glo- bal PV deployment has surged over the last decade. Concurrently, the rapid evolution of applications necessitates expedited advancements in solar cell technology to adapt to diverse scenarios, including inte- gration into buildings, vehicles, and aircrafts, where high power gen- eration per ﬁxed area is of primary concern14. Front and back contact (FBC) solar cell structure has dominated the mainstream PV market and demonstrated high power conversion efﬁciency (PCE) through the incorporation of passivating contact technologies such as silicon heterojunction (SHJ) and tunnel oxide passivating contact (TOPCon)59. Our previous works reported SHJ solar cells with a certiﬁed efﬁciency of up to 26.81%, attributed to the improved passivating contact characteristics1014. This device achieved a normalized electrical performance (open-circuit voltage (VOC) multiplies ﬁll factor (FF), and normalized by the Shockley- Queisser (SQ) limit of c-Si solar cells, i.e., (VOC  FF)/(VOC,SQ  FFSQ)) of 0.848, with optimized optical performance resulting in a short- circuit current density (JSC) of 41.45 mAcm2 15. Richter et al. reported n-type and p-type TOPCon solar cells with efﬁciency (normalized electrical performance) of 25.8% (0.789) and 26.0% (0.810), respectively, and JSC values approaching 42.87 mAcm2 and 42.05 mAcm2 1618. While FBC solar cells can achieve excellent results in electrical or optical characteristics individually. However, it is difﬁcult to manifest both in the same device due to the co-constraints existed, leaving FBC solar cells still face limitations19,20. Achieving low current density loss, optimal contact resistivity, and sufﬁcient pas- sivation quality simultaneously poses a vital role in further efﬁciency improvements21.

Moreover, the all-back-contact design alleviates con- straints on contact designs for both polarities, thereby reducing the challenge of balancing passivation and contact resistivity2224. In 2017, Kaneka Corporation in Japan realized heterojunction back contact (HBC) solar cell with an efﬁciency of up to 26.7% (JSC of 42.5 mAcm2)25,26, and recently, LONGi Corporation in China has announced a new record efﬁciency of 27.30%16. Institute for Solar Energy Research Hamelin (ISFH) in Germany reported a small-area polycrystalline silicon on oxide interdigitated back contact (POLO-IBC) solar cell with an efﬁciency of 26.1% (JSC of 42.6 mAcm2) deploying a laser patterning process2729. These ﬁndings indicate that back contact structures indeed enhance optics to support efﬁciency gains. How- ever, IBC solar cells necessitate optimized structural design to balance charge carrier recombination and transport on the rear side. The thin layers at the hole-selective contact (HSC) and electron-selective con- tact (ESC) regions are arranged in alternating rows, increasing device fabrication complexity and introducing numerous polarity bound- aries. Consequently, IBC solar cells are more susceptible to process- related contaminations and polarity boundary recombination com- pared to FBC solar cells. Additionally, IBC solar cells are prone to electrical shading effect, resulting in an ineffective collection of partial charge carriers23,3033. In this paper, we exploited amorphous silicon as passivating contact layers and laser ablation as a mass-production technology for fabricating HBC solar cells, achieving a certiﬁed efﬁciency of 27.09%. Rigorous experimental and theoretical validations were conducted for recombination loss, resistive loss, and current density loss. The research offers multiple strategies and guidelines for optimizing structural design and resolving major contradictions within back- contact solar cells. Results High-efﬁciency HBC solar cell Our HBC solar cell was realized on a large-area Czochralski wafer uti- lizing a laser patterning technique developed by our team. Figure 1a illustrates the HBC solar cell structure, featuring a textured front sur- face to minimize reﬂection loss and a polished rear surface to enhance the secondary or multiple absorption of the photons at longer wavelengths34,35. Additionally, interdigitated HSC and ESC regions with effective insulations in between are precisely patterned on the rear side using a laser ablation technology.

Wherein the electrical loss is mainly represented by the recombination cur- rent density (J0 with the ideality factor of 1 and 2) and the series resistance (RS). The extracted values and equivalent circuits are described in Fig. S2. Detailed information on the recombination model has been reported in our previous work11. The black dotted lines in the ﬁgure are the isometric contour, as demonstrated in Fig. S4. The magnitude of the triangular area enclosed by the three parameters indicates the strength of the solar cell electrical performance. Speciﬁcally, smaller area implies lower electrical loss, which beneﬁts the photoelectric performance of the solar cell. d Short-circuit current density loss (JSC loss) analysis of the three high- efﬁciency solar cells. The JSC loss are mainly represented by the shading effect (Jshade, including loss cuased by electrode shading and electrical shading) and the optical evaluation on the front and rear sides (Jfront and Jrear). The speciﬁc parameter values of the three solar cells are analyzed from respective external quantum efﬁ- ciency (EQE) and reﬂection curves, as described in Fig. S5.

We employ a simpliﬁed recombination model11, outlined in Fig. S2, along with proper methodology and procedure, to extract the key electrical parameters of this solar cell. As depicted in Fig. 1c, the model yields the recombination current density (including the ideality factor of 1 and 2, i.e., J01 and J02) and the series resistance (RS). Both J01 and J02 are crucial in determining the electrical performance of c-Si solar cells. The calculated J01, 1.1 fAcm2, beneﬁts from sophisticated i-a-Si:H multilayer process, advanced interfacial engineering, and laser abla- tion technology, resulting in a high VOC of 745 mV (Table 1). The pas- sivation advantage from Cell III, where an extremely high VOC of 751 mV was reported on a thin silicon wafer of 130 µm, is well demonstrated10. Considering the signiﬁcant inﬂuence of silicon wafer thickness on VOC 12,37, our HBC solar cell has exhibited one of the highest VOC values. In comparison to FBC conﬁguration, the interdigitated pattern of HBC solar cells leads to orders of magnitude longer polarity boundary, potentially inducing severe boundary recombination loss (recombi- nation parameter J02). The overlapping of conductive doped ﬁlms or the residual of transparent conductive oxide (TCO) layer at the boundaries can both generate J02 and severely degrade the solar cell performance30,38,39. Through appropriate built-in electrical ﬁeld gov- erning and polarity boundary controlling, we achieved a J02 down to 0.6 nAcm2, enabling a pseudo ﬁll factor (pFF) of up to 86.9% (Table 1), which is derived from the Suns-VOC measurement in Fig. S3. Regarding resistive loss, Fig. 1c shows that the RS of our HBC solar cell is around 0.34 Ωcm2, which has not yet been optimized to the desired level compared to Cell II (0.22 Ωcm2) and Cell III (0.20 Ωcm2). This is consistent with the analysis of pseudo IV curve (extracted from Suns- VOC measurement) and IV curve at the maximum power point (MPP) (Fig. S3). Notably, Cell III employed nanocrystalline-doped ﬁlms as transporting layers, while our HBC solar cells relied solely on amor- phous silicon layers. This endows advantages including low leakage (at the area near the n-p polarity boundary), low cost, low deposition difﬁculty, and high uniformity. The relationship between the three main parameters in Fig. 1c and the normalized electrical performance is detailed in Fig. S4. In addition to electrical analysis, the loss channels in JSC must be investigated, as shown in Fig. S5. Figure 1d reveals that the current density loss is tuned to an extremely superior condition on both the front and rear sides, together being lower than Cell III by 0.41 mAcm2. This indicates that the reﬂection and parasitic absorption of the front ﬁlm layers and free-carrier absorption of the rear TCO layer largely satisfy the stringent requirements for highly efﬁcient HBC solar cells. The all-back-contact structure inherently avoids electrode shading on the front side. However, the HBC solar cell is susceptible to electrical shading effects, ascarriersforboth polarities are collected on the same side. In this work, electrical shading induces a current density loss of 0.50 mAcm2, which is 0.25 mAcm2 lower than the electrode shading of Cell III, as shown in Fig. 1d. It is noteworthy that Cell I (da) and Cell II (da) obtained higher JSC values of 42.6 mAcm2 and 42.5 mAcm2, respectively. This is primarily attributed to the additional current gain from the thicker silicon wafer (175 µm and 200 µm) and the designated illumination area used in measurements, excluding the inﬂuences of recombination and leakage at the silicon wafer edge. Recombination correlating to ideality factors Due to the back-contact structural design, HBC solar cells introduce extra challenges regarding carrier recombination, particularly the parameter J02. Quantitatively evaluating J02 from various regions (HSC, ESC, gap, HSC + gap, as shown in Fig. 1a) of solar cells is challenging due to the submillimeter pitches. To address this, a group of indirect characterization techniques were developed (Fig. S6). First of all, a monitoring wafer (shown in Fig. 2a) was incorporated into the fabri- cation process. This wafer was laser-patterned into four regions (HSC, ESC, gap, HSC + gap) and underwent the same procedure as normal solar cells. J02 information was then extracted from the effective life- time of each region. Experiment (exp) and ﬁtted (ﬁt) lifetime curves of each region are shown in Fig. 2b with the separated measurements detailed in Fig. S6a and the ﬁtting model (Fig. S7a) explained in the Methods. Effective lifetimes of ESC and gap are close to 5000 μs under an injection level of 5  1015 cm3, while those of HSC and HSC + gap are much lower, indicating better surface passivation in the former two regions. Consequently, J02 values in Fig. 2c of HSC and HSC + gap are much higher than those of ESC and gap, rendering J02 recombi- nation from ESC and gap negligible in our normal cells. Notably, HSC + gap comprises HSC, gap, and their polarity boundary, as depicted in Fig. 1a. J02 of HSC + gap is 3.20 nAcm2, nearly 6 times higher than that of the HSC region alone and several orders of magnitude higher than that from the pure gap region, underscoring the signiﬁcant issue of polarity boundary-related J02 recombination in HBC solar cells. Gap region plays a negligible role in recombination loss of our device, which seems a contrary situation with the gap in tunneling oxide back contact (TBC) solar cells by Hollemann et al.40. In the reference work, due to the dopant inter-diffusion under high tem- perature, the larger and smaller widths of gap (dgap) exacerbate the recombination at the i-poly-Si/SiOx/c-Si interface and through lateral p(i)n diodes, respectively40. In other words, dgap has an optimum value to achieve the lowest gap recombination loss. The root reason for the different roles is the disparate gap structure designs. The gap layer stack we fabricated is SiNx/n-a-Si:H/i-a-Si:H/c-Si as shown in Fig. S1, while the structure in the reference is i-poly-Si/SiOx/c-Si. On the one hand, the passivation enhancement by dopant inter-diffusion is redundant for i-a-Si:H because the pretty good passivation quality could be provided by itself41. On the other hand, the lateral con- ductivity of doped amorphous silicon is much lower than that of doped crystalline silicon10. Such characteristic natively suppresses the leakage current from one polarity to the other. Therefore, the stack of SiNx/n-a-Si:H/i-a-Si:H/c-Si avoids to make balance between interface recombination and polarity leakage and could passivate the surface efﬁciently. To further evaluate polarity boundary recombination, a specia- lized wafer was fabricated alongside normal cells (Fig. 2d).

Nine sub-patterns and gap-only patterns were separately laid out on one wafer (Fig. S6b) with detailed description in the Methods. The current density of the gap sample is several orders of magnitude lower than that of samples from batch 1 and 2 (Fig. 2e), indicating negligible recombination current through the gap region compared to that caused by HSC and polarity bound- ary. Batch 1 and 2 represent the samples soaked in alkaline solution without and with additive in step 4 of fabrication process ﬂow (shown in Fig. S1), respectively. Concerning the same ratio of perimeter to area, recombination current density of solar cells from batch 1 is higher than that from batch 2 (Fig. 2e), suggesting severer recombination loss in batch 1. Notably, the recombination loss extracted from dark I-V originates from three regions: gap (negligible), HSC, and the polarity boundary between HSC and gap, as shown in Fig. S7b. All of the dark I-V curves are depicted in Fig. S8 And with the purpose of distinguishing the polarity boundary recombination, the dark I-V data need to be further processed.

Further- more, the loss can be divided separately by linear ﬁtting J02 and peri- meter/area (Fig. 2f), the physical meanings of the slope and the intercept are suggested in the Methods. The slope of batch 1 is higher than that of batch 2, indicating the relatively lower polarity boundary recombination in the latter. The microstructure of the polarity boundary between HSC and gap is revealed in the transmission elec- tron microscopy image of Fig. 1a. The polarity boundary of gap forms a concavity, where the subsequent TCO material burrows into during physical vapor deposition (PVD). Such a non-ideal polarity boundary, caused by wet etching, may induce detrimental boundary recombi- nation. The additive directly inﬂuences the etching procedure of the boundary in step 4 of the process ﬂow. Thus the J02 coming from polarity boundary could be reduced by adding additive into the solu- tion. Regulating the morphology of polarity boundary is an effective approach to improving the performances of HBC solar cells. Figure 2g demonstrates that increasing J01 and J02 results in a notable decrease in VOC and pFF. Through structural optimization and fabrication process improvements, J01 and J02 in our solar cells have been reduced to around 1.1 fAcm2 and 0.6 nAcm2, respectively. The ratio of (VOC  pFF)/(VOC,SQ  pFFSQ) exceeds 0.85, indicating the improved electrical performance. In the junction region of HSC, equilibrium-carrier concentrations (electron and hole) are much lower due to expulsion from the depletion region (Fig. S9). Here, a gradual change of carrier concentrations is assumed to depict the regions of HSC, polarity boundary, and ESC (gap), as shown in Fig. S9. In fact, the microstructure of the polarity boundary is much complicated and unclear although we have the transmission electron microscopy image. Nevertheless, the concavity at the boundary is visible in the image. And we could legitimately infer that there are lots of defects and contaminants in this region. These features would weaken the near-surface band bending in the c-Si42. Therefore, in our calculation, a lower built-in electrical ﬁeld than that of HSC is assumed to equiva- lently simulate the polarity boundary, as shown in Fig. S9. The Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) recombination lifetime for electron and hole (τn0 and τp0) in the c-Si bulk region are both set as 15 ms. The local sketch of cell showing the surface, the junctions and the bulk is dis- played on the left of Fig. 2h. The surface is two-dimensional in the practical cell and we assume a very thin ﬁlm to describe it here. The energy band diagrams of HSC, the polarity boundary and ESC (gap) are depicted in Fig. 2h (the left graph in each group). Recombination rates (U) and the ideality factors (m) under the injection level of 3  1015cm3 are also calculated and shown in Fig. 2h (the middle and the right graphs in each group, respectively). In the HSC region, from A1 to A2, the ideality factor on the surface is higher than 1 because of the surface recombination in the p/n built-in electrical ﬁeld. Besides, the SRH recombination makes the ideality factor in the p/n junction exceed 1 (Fig. S10) due to the low carrier concentration in this region (Fig. S9). And in the bulk, the dominant Auger recombination diminishes the ideality factor to below 1. Therefore, the J02 recombination of HSC comes from its surface and junction. As for polarity boundary, from B1 to B2, the J02 recombination is caused by the surface and junction just like HSC. And the lower built-in electrical ﬁeld makes the ideality factor on the surface very close to 2. And the recombination rate increases at the same time. Consequently, the J02 recombination caused by the polarity boundary is violent. In terms of ESC (gap), from D1 to D2 (from C1 to C2), the ideality factor is no longer higher than 1, no matter on the surface, in the junction or in the bulk. Thats why the J02 recombination from these two regions could be ignored. In short, the J02 recombi- nation of the cell is from two regions, HSC (surface and junction) and polarity boundary. And the former could be suppressed by enhancing the built-in electrical ﬁeld and the latter could be reduced by managing the morphology of the boundary. Contacts evaluation and design According to the Suns-VOC and the light I-V tests, the total RS loss at MPP is around 337.2 mΩcm2, which can be disaggregated into four components: the resistive loss from HSC stacks (n-c-Si/i-a-Si:H/ p-a-Si:H/TCO/Ag), the resistive loss from ESC stacks (n-c-Si/i-a-Si:H/n-a- Si:H/TCO/Ag), the metal resistive loss (ﬁngers to busbars) and other loss sources (such as bulk resistance), as illustrated in Fig. 3a, b. The transfer length method (TLM)43,44 was employed to extract the contact resistivity (ρc) of HSC based on p-a-Si:H using p-c-Si sub- strate and the ρc of ESC based on n-a-Si:H using n-c-Si substrate, as shown in Fig. S11a, b, respectively. The colored lines in Fig. S11a, b represent the dark IV curves of two electrodes with different inter- electrode gap spacing. The insets in Fig. S11a, b plot the extracted resistance against the inter-electrode gap spacing. From the linear ﬁt, we extracted a contact resistivity of 51.3 mΩcm2 for HSC and 46.1 mΩcm2 for ESC. The resistive loss from HSC stacks is calculated by RHSC = ρc(HSC)/AHSC, where AHSC represents the HSC contact area. The resistive loss from ESC stacks is calculated similarly. At MPP, the predominant RS stems from HSC and ESC, primarily due to the high contact resistivity associated with the doped a-Si:H layers. The RS loss can be reduced by introducing doped nc-Si(Ox):H layers. With the current structural design, the transition from using doped a-Si:H material to nc-Si(Ox):H can improve FF of the device, while in the local area where HSC and ESC are in contact, the risk of current leakage increases as a result of facilitated tunneling transport through the HSC/ESC interface since a lower Ea enabled by the doped layers45. Notably, compared to devices employing doped a-Si:H lay- ers, our approach demonstrates a substantial enhancement in the contact resistivity of the HSC region10. Further analysis of the resis- tive loss in the ESC and HSC regions reveals improvements in the contact resistivity near TCO and substrate interfaces. These enhancements are attributed to optimized intrinsic (i-a-Si:H) and doped (p-a-Si:H) amorphous silicon layers, which decrease the con- tact resistivity within the n-c-Si/i-a-Si:H/p-a-Si:H and p-a-Si:H/TCO stacks46, as shown in Fig. 3c. Speciﬁcally, the microstructure para- meter tests indicate a narrowed bandgap in the i-a-Si:H layer near the p-a-Si:H/i-a-Si:H interface as depicted in Fig. S11c, easing direct tun- neling at this interface21. Moreover, the lower activation energy observed in the p-a-Si:H layer adjacent to the p-a-Si:H/TCO interface facilitates carrier tunnel through p-a-Si/TCO interface, as illustrated in Fig. S11d. This optimization is further elucidated through com- parative schematic band diagrams in Fig. 3d. Figure 3e displays simulated RS map for typical HBC and FBC solar cells concerning ρc in the HSC and ESC region, excluding metal resistive loss. The range of color bars suggests a higher change ratio of RS against ρc(HSC) and ρc(ESC) in HBC compared to FBC solar cells, indicating the greater inﬂuence of ρc on HBC solar cell performance. Thus, meticulous design and ﬁne-tuning of the HSC and ESC cover- age area ratio are crucial. Unlike FBC solar cells where HSC and ESC cover the entire front or rear surface, their coverage area in HBC solar cells is adjustable, impacting total RS of the device. The design principle aims to minimize the resistive loss from HSC and ESC, contingent upon the ratio of ρc(HSC) and ρc(ESC). As shown in Fig. 3f, the optimal coverage area ratio can be calculated by the following equation: Y = arg min 1 Y + X 1  Y   = 1ﬃﬃﬃ X p + 1 ð1Þ Where X = ρc(HSC)/ρc(ESC) is the ratio of HSC region contact resistivity and ESC region contact resistivity, Y = AESC/AHSC+ESC is the optimal ratio of ESC coverage area to the total area. Moreover, minimizing the gap region area is imperative without compromising on increasing current leakage.

The enhancement of EQE measured with da compared to ta across all wavelengths is nearly spectrum-independent, indicating the JSC loss is not from the optical channel but from recombination. Typically, recombination-induced JSC loss (Jrec) evenly impacts EQE across all wavelengths, akin to electrode shading, termed electrical shade loss (Jshade). Moreover, a detailed optical loss analysis using SunSolve software (as depicted in Fig. S12) revealed that JSC loss from front reﬂection and parasitic absorption of front layers (i-a-Si:H/SiNx) pri- marily affects EQE below 950 nm wavelength (Jfront), while the parasitic absorption of rear layers (i-a-Si:H/p-a-Si:H/TCO and i-a-Si:H/n-a-Si:H/ TCO stacks) and escape reﬂection predominantly affect EQE beyond 950 nm wavelength (Jrear). The inset in Fig. 4a illustrates the HBC solar cell structure and the three main current density losses mentioned above. Concerning Jshade, it possibly arises from minority carriers (holes) recombination in the non-collection regions (ESC and gap region), due to their longer transport length (L2) to reach the collection region (HSC interface). This recombination current density loss is evidently wavelength-independent. Figure 4b shows the corresponding simulation results by Quokka 3 software. The upper panel simulates light beam induced current (LBIC, 20 µm width, 1 sun intensity, scanning from left to right in the X direction), which can be represented by the internal quantum efﬁ- ciency (IQE, i.e., JSC/Jgen, where Jgen is the photogeneration current in silicon wafer). Notably, IQE at the HSC region (transparent red color) nearly reaches 100% as minority carriers above the HSC region are closer to the collection region. Conversely, minority carriers at the ESC and gap region (transparent blue color) exhibit a longer transport length before collection, resulting in lower IQE compared to the HSC region. IQE curve in this region further diminishes with increasing surface recombination of the ESC and gap region (SESC, gap), i.e. from 98% of SESC, gap = 1 cms1 to 90% of SESC, gap = 64 cms1. To elucidate intermediate recombination, we depict the current distribution cor- responding to SESC, gap = 64 cms1 under 1 sun intensity (with full-area illumination) in the bottom panel. The HSC region shows one- dimensional current ﬂow from the front surface to the rear side, whereas the ESC region displays two branches of the current ﬂow: one perpendicular to the rear side and the other horizontal to the HSC interface, resulting in very high current density at the edge of the HSC region. More importantly, the direction of the current at the interface of ESC/n-c-Si is not parallel to the ESC surface, contrasting sharply with SESC, gap = 1 cms1 conditions (Fig. S13), suggesting a por- tion of the current directly ﬂows to the interface of ESC/n-c-Si for recombination. Based on the lifetime test results of the ESC and gap regions in Fig. 2b, it is determined that the corresponding SESC, gap should be less than 3 cms1, resulting in a total Jrec (the integral from 0 to 390 in the X axis) of less than 0.1 mAcm2. This value is signiﬁcantly smaller than the estimated Jshade from Fig. 1d. Further examination of wafer edge using the light beam induced current (LBIC) method reveals in Fig. 4c, where the LBIC intensity uniformly decreases from 2.8 mA (maximum value) at the left edge of the nearest HSC region to 0 at the edge of the solar cell. This wafer edge region is estimated to contribute approximately half of the JSC compared to the main part of the solar cell. Assuming an averaged span distance of 0.750.85 mm, the calculated Jshade from wafer edge region in M6 size wafer reaches (4  (0.0750.085) cm)  16.6 cm  21 mAcm2/274.4 cm2 = (0.380.43) mAcm2. Additionally, the magni- ﬁed view of the LBIC scan indicates a current density difference of roughly 0.5 mAcm2 between the peaks and troughs of the ESC and HSC regions, nearly consistent with the simulated scenario of SESC, gap = 4 cms1 in Fig. 4b. Thus their overall contribution to current density loss from SESC, gap is about 0.1 mAcm2, accounting for 20% of the total Jshade (0.5 mAcm2). Simulation results suggest that wafer edge recombination-induced current density loss can be controlled to below 0.1 mAcm2 (Fig. S14) with effective wafer edge passivation.

Article https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-53275-5 Nature Communications| (2024) 15:8931 6 In HBC solar cells, electrical shading is primarily inﬂuenced by the ESC or gap region, recombination at the front surface, and the quality of the silicon wafer. Recombination in the HSC region has a lesser important impact on JSC (Fig. S15). Jrec is mainly determined by carrier transport length and recombination rate. Figure 4d shows a calculation of Jrec as a function of carrier transport length (Ltr) and equivalent effective minority lifetime (τeff). The inset model illustrates the trans- port of photo-generated carriers (Jgen) from the right to the left of the device, where they are collected effectively (JSC) or undergo recom- bination on the path (Jrec) with different τeff and Ltr. For convenience, τeff is equivalent to τbulk under perfect surface passivation (i.e., J0 surf = 0.001 fAcm2), with the bulk lifetime set to a ﬁxed value. A simple equation can be derived from the transport equation and the boundary condition: Jrec = Jgen 1  1 cosh L Lp   2 4 3 5 ð2Þ Where Lp = (Dp  τeff)1/2 is the diffusion length of hole carrier, and Dp 11.9 cm2s1 is the diffusion coefﬁcient of the hole carrier. As depicted in Fig. 4d, the results obtained from Quokka 3 simulations (hollow circles) closely alight with these calculated by Eq. (2) (solid lines). Consequently, Eq. (2) or Fig. 4d can be employed to quickly evaluate Jrec across various cell structures, spatial positions, and applied voltages. Notably, in HBC solar cells, the lateral width of the ESC region is signiﬁcantly larger compared to the carrier transport length (up to the thickness of the silicon wafer) of the traditional FBC solar cells, increasing the likelihood of substantial electrical shading if τeff in this region is suboptimal. For example, at X = 390 µm in Fig. 4b, with Ltr = 270 µm (from the front surface at X = 390 µm to the edge of collection region), and τeff = 0.26 ms for SESC, gap = 64 cms1, IQE can be quickly calculated as IQE = (1-Jrec/Jgen) = (1/cosh(L/Lp)) = 89.2%. In another scenario, despite negligible surface recombination, if the sili- con wafer quality is low (e.g., τbulk = 1 ms), Jrec in the middle of the ESC (X = 390 µm in Fig. 4b) can increase from 0.1 mAcm2 (for τbulk = 16 ms) to 1.2 mAcm2. Opportunities and perspectives Analysis of the HBC solar cell reveals signiﬁcant potential for improv- ing its photoelectric performance. Compared to nanocrystalline sili- con, amorphous silicon has not effectively suppressed charge carrier transport loss due to inefﬁcient transport at the interface between the doped layer and the TCO layer (Fig. 5a), not fulﬁlling band-to-band tunneling mechanism based on direct energy transitions. To enhance efﬁciency, adopting nanocrystalline silicon technology for improving Fig. 4 | The short-circuit current density (JSC) loss analysis in HBC solar cell. a External quantum efﬁciency (EQE) spectrum with two different test area.

Using nanocrystalline silicon for both HSC and ESC stacks without oxygen alloy doping achieves low contact resistivity values of ρc(HSC) = 3.6 mΩcm2 and ρc(ESC) = 15 mΩcm2 10,47,48. Under the model illustrated in Fig. 3e, f and conjunction with the optimized rear structural design, the resistive loss can be minimized to 0.12 Ωcm2, as shown in Cell IV of Table 2. Such decline of resistive loss would make FF increase from 85.08% to 86.22%. Consequently, the normalized electrical performance (VOC  FF)/(VOC,SQ  FFSQ) improves from 0.832 to 0.843, enhancing the absolute efﬁciency by 0.35%. Furthermore, integrating less resistive SiOx/poly-Si stacks with i-a-Si:H/doped-a-Si:H stacks forms hybrid solar cells with even better performance potential4952. Based on Cell IV, it is prospective to decrease the recombination parameters J01 and J02 to the same level of Cell III by fully reinforcing the combined effects such as ﬁeld-effect passivation and polarity boundary passivation, just as shown as Cell V in Table 2. On the one hand, in consideration of the main electrical difference between amorphous silicon and nanocrys- talline silicon, enhancing the built-in electric ﬁeld in the p/n junction is one of the most promising methods to suppress J01 and J02 (as shown in Fig. 2h). On the other hand, HBC cells usually have extra recombination loss from their non-ideal polarity boundary as shown in Figs. 1a and 2b. Thus boundary management is another promising method to reduce J01 and J02. If these methods are felicitously utilized on the HBC cell, its VOC and FF would increase to 746.5 mV and 86.54%, respectively. And, thus the parameter (VOC  FF)/(VOC,SQ  FFSQ) can be optimized to 0.847, as depicted in Fig. 5a. However, JSC of the HBC solar cell with a total area in this work is only 42.1 mAcm2, 0.4 mAcm2 lower than Cell II, due to the electrical shading effect in the ESC region and wafer edge recombination effects. Excluding the wafer edge region, the same HBC solar cell with a designated area of 243 cm2 can achieve a JSC of up to 42.6 mAcm2. The issue of wafer edge recombination loss can be well addressed by improving ﬁlm uniformity, avoiding wrap-around coatings, and implementing secondary passivation on wafer edge (such as atomic- layer-deposited AlOx thin ﬁlms or spin-coated organic passivation layers of PEDOT:PSS and carbon nanotube)5357. Meanwhile, coupled with an optimized rear structure design enables suppress the electrical shading loss Jshade from 0.50 mAcm2 down to below 0.1 mAcm2, as described in Cell IV in Fig. 5b and Table 2. In other words, the JSC could be increased to 42.5 mAcm2 by suppressing the electrical shading effect. And Jrear decreasing from 0.69 mAcm2 to 0.59 mAcm2 by preventing the free-carrier parasitic absorption of TCO brings addi- tional increase of 0.1 mAcm2 for JSC. Moreover, meticulous optimi- zation of the front anti-reﬂection coating and rear reﬂector is crucial. For instance, replacing the front layer (i-a-Si:H/SiNx) with AlOx/SiNx or SiOx/SiNx stacks and preparing silver mirror or other rear reﬂection enhancement layers willimprove spectrum management capabilities58, reducing the Jfront from 0.59 mAcm2 to 0.35 mAcm2 and leading to a promising JSC of 42.8 mAcm2, i.e., Cell V in Table 2. Leveraging this high-efﬁciency HBC solar cell as a benchmark demonstrates its advantages over FBC solar cells. As mentioned above, both the nor- malized electrical performance of 0.847 and the JSC of 42.8 mAcm2 are feasible. It suggests that a conversion efﬁciency of up to 27.7% is achievable with optimal practices, i.e., Cell V in Table 2. Discussion Through extensive research and analysis of the core optimization direction in the preparation process of HBC solar cells, we have achieved a high PCE of 27.09%.

By comparing these parameters with two previous record silicon solar cells, we observed the suppression of surface recombi- nation of J01 and J02 in this HBC solar cell compared to Kenekas HBC solar cell, along with signiﬁcant advantages in Jshade and Jfront compared to our previous FBC (SHJ) solar cell. In our investigation of J01 and J02, we utilized zone-resolved min- ority carrier lifetime testing and variations of polarity boundary peri- meter I-V curves to precisely deﬁne the J02 source region. Our ﬁndings indicate that J02 in HBC solar cells primarily originates from the HSC region and the polarity boundary of HSC/gap region. Through opti- mization, we have successfully reduced the J02 down to 0.6 nAcm2 (compared to Kanekas J021.3 nAcm2). Additionally, by analyzing the ideality factor proﬁle corresponding to each recombination region, we have identiﬁed insufﬁcient band bending in the HSC region and the boundary of HSC/gap region as the primary causes of J02. In our examination of RS, we found that contact resistivity plays a pivotal role in high-efﬁciency HBC solar cells, mainly due to a sig- niﬁcant reduction in the contact area of the HSC or ESC region. By optimizing the HSC region, we achieved the lowest contact resistivity (55 mΩcm2) using p-a-Si:H ﬁlm. Furthermore, we determined that the contribution of contact resistivity to RS can be directly calculated based on the coverage area ratio. Optimal RS is achieved by main- taining an inverse proportion between the HSC and ESC coverage area ratio and their corresponding contact resistivity. In terms of JSC loss, we conducted a detailed breakdown and quantiﬁcation of Jfront, Jrear, and Jshade using EQE and reﬂection curve analyses. Simulations and LBIC tests have shown that minority carriers in the ESC and gap regions of HBC solar cells experience higher rates of recombination due to their longer transport lengths, resulting in an electrical shading effect. Additionally, signiﬁcant recombination at the wafer edge region of the solar cell competes with the HSC region near the wafer edge for minority carriers, resulting in 50% of JSC loss. This phenomenon accounts for over 80% of electrical shading in our HBC solar cell during full-area testing. Furthermore, we have developed a simpliﬁed equation to elucidate the relationship between Jrec, Ltr, and τeff, enabling quick assessments of the extent of electrical shading. Finally, we have presented the two key aspects in three- dimensional graphs, showcasing the optimization space for both electrical and optical designs. By incorporating the nanocrystalline technology from the 26.81% efﬁciency solar cell, addressing wafer edge effects while maintaining other parameters, and meticulous optimi- zation of front anti-reﬂection coating and rear reﬂector, it is practical to achieve an HBC solar cell with PCE surpassing 27.7%. Methods Device fabrication Solar cell fabrication. In this work, solar cells were fabricated using the commercial HBC research and development line on LONGi M6 (274.3 cm2) n-type Czochralski wafer with a resistivity of 1.21.5 Ωcm and a thickness of 200 µm in (100) orientation. The main steps for HBC solar cell fabrication using the laser patterning technique are shown in Fig. S1, involving multi-step wet chemical cleaning, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), laser ablation, PVD, and metallization process. (1) Wet chemical cleaning - 1: the rear surface was polished through iso- tropic etching, while the front wafer surface was textured via aniso- tropic etching into pyramids sized 13 µm, featuring (111) oriented facets. Prior to subsequent deposition, the thickness of the wafer was veriﬁed by weight measurement, conﬁrming it to be 175 µm. (2) CVD deposition - 1: after a brief dip in a diluted hydroﬂuoric solution, the rear side passivation was achieved using i-a-Si:H/n-a-Si:H/SiNx/i-a-Si:H stack, where the SiNx/i-a-Si:H stack was used as a laser sacriﬁcial layer or an etch stop layer in the subsequent process. (3) Laser patterning - 1: a pulsed green picosecond laser (100 kHz, 532 nm, ps) was employed to ablate the outermost sacriﬁcial layer (i-a-Si:H) of the HSC region. (4) Wet chemical cleaning - 2: the SiNx layer was acid-etched (HF), and the n-a-Si:H/i-a-Si:H stack was alkaline-etched (KOH), which ensures the n- c-Si is undamaged and retains a clean surface for subsequent CVD process. (5) CVD deposition - 2: The i-a-Si:H/p-a-Si:H stack was depos- ited on the rear side and formed a good passivating contact perfor- mance in the HSC region. (6) Laser patterning - 2: a pulsed green picosecond laser (100 kHz, 532 nm, ps) was applied to ablate the overlying i-a-Si:H/p-a-Si:H stack in the designed ESC region. (7) Wet chemical cleaning - 3: the SiNx layer and laser-induced oxidation layer were etched by HF acid to forms the surface of n-c-Si/i-a-Si:H/n-a-Si:H. (8) CVD deposition - 3: the front side was coated with i-a-Si:H/SiNx/SiOx stack, which serves as both passivation layer and anti-reﬂection coat- ing. (9) PVD deposition: the TCO layer was deposited using the mag- netron sputtering technique. The TCO layer consisted of conventional 10 wt% SnO2 doped In2O3, and was prepared simultaneously for both the HSC and ESC regions using a single deposition recipe. (10) Laser patterning - 3: a pulsed ultra-violet picosecond laser (400 kHz, 355 nm, ps) ablated the designed gap region to remove TCO/p-a-Si:H/i-a-Si:H stack for isolation, avoiding leakage channels. And, the SiNx layer served as barrier layer to prevent the passivation performance of i-a- Si:H/n-a-Si:H from being damaged. (11) Metallization: silver grid elec- trodes were printed and subjected to a curing process at 170 C in an annealing furnace. Finally, light soaking was performed under 30 suns for 90 s at 200 C. Lifetime monitoring sample fabrication. The lifetime monitoring sample was fabricated on a M6 Czochralski n-c-Si wafer with the same bulk resistivity and wafer thickness as used in Solar cell fabrication. The monitoring sample underwent the same fabrication ﬂow as the normal solar cell except for three processes. Firstly, the sample was processed according to the four-region pattern design (HSC, ESC, gap, HSC + gap) rather than the normal cell pattern at every laser step. Second, prior to the deposition of the TCO layer, the high-temperature tape was applied to the gaps between each region. This tape was removed after the PVD process to prevent carrier transportation between regions. Thirdly, the sample was not printed but subjected to annealing and light soaking along with the normal solar cells. The lifetime after light soaking was subsequently measured and analyzed. Dark IV monitoring sample fabrication. The dark IV monitoring sample was also fabricated on the M6 Czochralski n-c-Si wafer with the same bulk resistivity and wafer thickness as used in Solar cell fabri- cation. One side of the wafer underwent the patterning process rea- lized by laser technology. This side was divided into the periodic HSC and gap regions, as shown in Fig. 2d. The opposite side of the wafer was occupied entirely by the ESC region. After this, a TCO layer was deposited on both surfaces. Silver electrodes were then fabricated in the ESC region and the sub-patterns using a mask plate. Performance characterization The light I-V curves of the HBC solar cell with the total area and designated illumination area were tested and certiﬁed by ISFH. The measurements of EQE (ta and da) curves in Fig. 4a and the reﬂection curve in Fig. S5a were performed by our lab (test instrument: PVE300- IVT210). Whereas the current density loss involved in Figs. 1 and 5 were analyzed based on the EQE (ta) measurement by ISFH, which curve was shown in Fig. S5a. It is worth noting that the EQE (ta) measurement by our lab was calibrated and aligned with ISFH. The measured JSC in the light I-V measurement was consistent with the JSC calculated from the spectral response measurement. The EQE curve was derived by inte- grating the spectral response curve. The pseudo I-V curve in Fig. S3 was measured on Sinton instrument (Suns-VOC MX). Notably, all these tests are performed on the same solar cell. The lifetime was measured on Sinton instrument (WCT-120 MX) in transient mode. To obtain lifetime information for each region (HSC, ESC, gap, HSC + gap), each region was moved to the center of the stage Article https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-53275-5 Nature Communications| (2024) 15:8931 9 to completely cover the sensor region, as illustrated in Fig. S6a. The dark I-V of the monitoring cells was tested using a semiconductor analyzer (Keithley 4200A-SCS). As shown in Fig. 2d, the probes con- tacted the electrodes of the front and rear sides. The voltage was swept from 0 V to 2 V in 0.01 V increment. Contact resistivity was calculated using the TLM43,44. Micro- structure parameters of i-a-Si:H layers were determined from the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy measurements by ﬁtting peaks corresponding to Si-H bond and Si-H2 bonds and comparing their area shares5961. Activation energies of doped-a-Si:H layers were determined from the electrical conductivity as a function of tem- perature, with electrical conductivities obtained from I-V curves mea- sured by a semiconductor analyzer. The LBIC measurement was performed using a 532 nm laser with a spot diameter of 20 µm. Theoretical calculation and simulation J02 extracted from lifetime curves. A simpliﬁed recombination model was used to ﬁt the lifetime curves, as shown in Fig. S7a. The effective lifetime τeff can be divided into ﬁve components, as expressed in Eq. (3). Unlike the model used in I-V curve ﬁtting, this model does not consider series resistance RS and shunt resistance Rsh. The electron SRH recombination lifetime τn0 was set as 15 ms and equal to the hole SRH recombination lifetime τp0. Please note that,τn0 and τp0 are the physical quantities used to calculate effective bulk SRH lifetime (τSRH), corresponding to SRH electron lifetime and SRH hole lifetime, respectively. And τ01 and τ02 are used to describe the surface recom- bination, corresponding to J01 and J02 recombination, respectively. Bulk resistivity and wafer thickness were 1.5 Ωcm and 175 µm, respec- tively. 1 τeff = 1 τrad + 1 τAuger + 1 τSRH + 1 τ01 + 1 τ02 ð3Þ J02 extracted from dark IV curves. As shown in Fig. S7b, dark IV curves consist of three types of recombination: HSC (JHSC), gap (Jgap), and the boundary between the HSC and gap (Jbound.). These recombi- nations are mathematically correlated, as shown in Eq. (4). Jdark is the current density obtained by dividing the dark current Idark by the total area of the HSC (AHSC) and gap (Agap) regions. Lbound. is the length of the boundary between the HSC and gap. In Fig. 2f, the measured and ﬁtted correlation between J02 and Lbound./(AHSC+Agap) is illustrated. The slope of this correlation reﬂects polarity boundary recombination ( Jbound.), while the intercept provides information on the recombina- tion in the HSC region (JHSC), as the recombination of the gap region is negligible. Jdark = JHSC AHSC AHSC + Agap + Jgap Agap AHSC + Agap + Jbound: Lbound: AHSC + Agap ð4Þ The metal resistive loss calculation. Both HSC and ESC regions have m busbars and n ﬁngers, respectively. The metal resistive loss is cal- culated by the following question: Rmetal = 1 m1 Rsf c=n + 2 Rsf e=n ð5Þ Where, Rsf_e = (L  Rl)/4 is the effective resistance of a single ﬁnger in the edge, L is ﬁnger length between busbars and ﬁnger length in the edge is L/2, Rl is the ﬁnger resistance per length. Rsf c = R Rsf t 0 1 1 x + 1 Rsf tx dx is the effective resistance of a single ﬁnger between busbars, and Rsf_t = (Rl  L) is the total resistance of a single ﬁnger between busbars. The Quokka 3 simulation. The unit cell was modeled in 3D to calculate the LBIC and spatial mapping of current ﬂow, as shown in Fig. 4b. By default, the resistivity, thickness, and lifetime of the silicon wafer were set to 1.5 Ωcm, 175 µm, and 15 ms, respectively. The default recombi- nation current density was set to 0.5 fAcm2.
