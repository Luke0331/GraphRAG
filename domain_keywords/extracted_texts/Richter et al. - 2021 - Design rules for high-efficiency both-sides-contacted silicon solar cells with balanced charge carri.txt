Over the past few years, this field experienced impres- sive improvements in power conversion efficiency2, which resulted not only from the prototype devices of research laboratories35 but also from mass production69. This efficiency progress is crucial for cost reduction. The improvements were mainly possible because the technological potential was not fully utilized. On top of the strong and steady success in production technology and engineering, some advanced technologies have substantially enhanced the scope of silicon solar cells in recent years. For instance, passivating contacts based on hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H)10,11 or poly- crystalline silicon thin films (also known as SIPOS12,13, poly-Si14,15, POLO3 or tunnel oxide passivating contact (TOPCon)16), which combine very low surface recombination losses with an efficient current extraction, alleviate some fundamental limitations of the still-dominating direct metal contacts to diffused or alloyed junc- tions2,17. The application of these passivating contacts led to recent conversion efficiencies of up to 26.7% for a solar cell with the col- lecting junction and both metal contacts at the rear, the so-called interdigitated back contact (IBC) solar cells5,18, and 25.8% for a solar cell with the collecting junction at the front surface and metal con- tacts on the front and back surfaces4,19. With a market share of over 95%, these front and back contact (FBC) cells clearly dominate c-Si solar cell mass production. For these high-performance FBC devices with highly optimized individual process technologies, the related avoidable losses, for example, due to surface recombination or grid shading, are more and more suppressed. This, in turn, increases the effect of design-related losses or even fundamental losses that arise, for instance, from charge carrier transport towards local metal contacts or Auger recombination in the c-Si bulk, respectively19. To reduce the gap to the fundamental efficiency limit of c-Si solar cells of around 29.4% (refs. 20,21), it therefore becomes increasingly important to identify an ultimate cell design for efficiencies beyond 26%. This goal is cru- cial for the PV industry as the question of the ultimate technical efficiency limit for c-Si solar cells determines the PV roadmap, that is, at what point will it be necessary to switch to advanced and more complex concepts, such as tandem solar cells22. In this study we aim to identify such an ultimate design for FBC c-Si solar cells by addressing the individual loss mechanisms of different cell designs together with the choice of the wafer dop- ing. Therefore, we first investigated different cell designs experi- mentally at a very high performance level up to a conversion efficiency of 26%. The theoretical understanding of the key fac- tors that influence the conversion efficiency is substantially more complex for these highest-performance devices. For instance, some highly efficient cells no longer operate in the so-called low-injection conditions, which can result in misguidance when the established design rules of common solar cells are applied. We address this by a simulation-based detailed power-loss analysis, which provides accurate insight into the performance differences and enables a further comparison of a variety of cell designs. From these insights we derived design rules for future 26% efficiency FBC c-Si solar cells. Performance characteristics of different cell designs In the past, exceptionally high silicon device performances have been realized with different cell designs (Figs. 1 and 2), which can be classified into FBC cells with a front junction (FJ) or back junc- tion (BJ), and IBC cells with both contacts at the back side. The strong efficiency improvements up to 25% in the 1990s were realized with PERL cells (Fig. 2a), a p-type c-Si FJ FBC cell that combines very small local contacts with high-quality dielectric sur- face passivation23,24. The PERC design2528, with very similar design Design rules for high-efficiency both-sides- contacted silicon solar cells with balanced charge carrier transport and recombination losses Armin Richter 1 , Ralph Müller1, Jan Benick1, Frank Feldmann1, Bernd Steinhauser 1, Christian Reichel1, Andreas Fell1, Martin Bivour1, Martin Hermle1 and Stefan W. Glunz1,2 The photovoltaic industry is dominated by crystalline silicon solar cells. Although interdigitated back-contact cells have yielded the highest efficiency, both-sides-contacted cells are the preferred choice in industrial production due to their lower complex- ity. Here we show that omitting the layers at the front side that provide lateral charge carrier transport is the key to excellent optoelectrical properties for both-sides-contacted cells. This results in a conversion efficiency of 26.0%. In contrast to stan- dard industrial cells with a front side pn junction, this cell exhibits the pn junction at the back surface in the form of a full-area polycrystalline silicon-based passivating contact. A detailed power-loss analysis reveals that this cell balances electron and hole transport losses as well as transport and recombination losses in general. A systematic simulation study led to some fun- damental design rules for future 26% efficiency silicon solar cells and demonstrates the potential and the superiority of these back-junction solar cells.

Although PERL cells have an outstanding optical performance, the high electrical performance is limited by recombination at the local metal contacts with its poor passivation via heavy doping2. The a-Si:H-based silicon heterojunction (SHJ) technology with its full-area passivating contacts on the front and back surfaces pre- vents such local recombination losses at the metal contacts (Fig. 2b). This technology led to 25.1% FBC cells8,30 and to the 26.7% IBC cell (Fig. 2c). SHJ cells exhibit a very high electrical performance (Fig. 1e). However, the optical performance of FBC SHJ cells is sub- stantially limited by parasitic absorption losses due to the full-area a-Si:H layer at the front surface11 and the transparent conductive oxide (TCO) on top required for lateral current transport. If applied to the front surface, full-area poly-Si-based passivating contacts suffer from similar optical losses31. To benefit from both, a full-area passivating contact and a transparent dielectric surface passivation, we developed n-type c-Si solar cells with a B-diffused emitter at the front and a full-area TOPCon at the back16 (Fig. 2d). TOPCon, which consists of an ultra-thin SiOx layer capped with doped poly-Si, shows, in contrast to a-Si:H, a high temperature tol- erance which renders it compatible with processes such as dopant diffusion32,33 or firing required for the standard screen printed met- allization34,35. These FJ cells resulted in an efficiency up to 25.8% (refs. 4,19), with a high optical performance. The high electrical per- formance, mainly due to the full-area TOPCon back contact with its simple one-dimensional current flow pattern for electrons36, is still lower than that of the SHJ cells, as the front-side emitter requires a balancing of recombination and current transport losses19. 1990 2000 2010 2020 1990 2000 2010 2020 1990 2000 2010 2020 690 700 710 720 730 740 750 760 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 78 80 82 84 86 1990 2000 2010 Year Year Year Year 2020 22 23 24 25 26 27 FJ SHJ FJ BJ SHJ BJ IBC SHJ IBC VOC (mV) a e b c d JSC (mA cm2) FF (%) Efficiency (%) PERL FJ (UNSW) Kaneka POLO (ISFH) Panasonic Sanyo/ Panasonic Kaneka SunPower FJ TOPCon (FhG ISE) Hanergy TOPCon BJ (this work) SHJ IBC 26.7% (Kaneka) SHJ FJ 25.1% (Kaneka) SHJ BJ 25.1% (Hanergy) FJ TOPCon 25.8% (FhG ISE) TOPCon BJ 26.0% (this work) SHJ FJ (Sanyo/Panasonic) PESC, PERC, PERL FJ (UNSW) 28% 27% 25% 24% 23% 22% 21% 26% 29% PERL FJ 25% (UNSW) 0.70 0.75 0.80 0.85 0.90 0.85 0.90 0.95 1.00 Optical fraction JSC/JSC,SQ Electrical fraction VOC  FF / (VOC,SQ  FFSQ) Auger limit Fig. 1 | Overview of notable silicon solar cells. a, Efficiency evolution over the past 30 years for different cell architectures: the PERL (passivated emitter, rear locally diffused) cells with a diffused n+ FJ reported by the University of New South Wales (UNSW)7275,23,76, the a-Si:H-based SHJ FJ cells reported by Sanyo/Panasonic7785 and Kaneka30, the SHJ BJ cell reported by Hanergy8, the TOPCon FJ cells with a diffused p+ FJ reported by Fraunhofer ISE4,19,36, the IBC cells reported by SunPower8688 and ISFH3, and the SHJ IBC cells reported by Panasonic89 and Kaneka5,18.

Nature Energy | VOL 6 | April 2021 | 429438 | www.nature.com/natureenergy 430 Articles NATure Energy These device results demonstrate clearly the high relevance of passivating contacts, which are used for all 25% cells, and of the BJ design, as all 26% cells are IBC cells. If the BJ design is applied to FBC cells, a large portion of the lateral charge carrier transport towards local metal contacts at the front can be accomplished by the silicon wafer itself. This relaxes the requirements for the front side lateral conductivity provided by the TCO of SHJ cells37,38 or the highly doped emitter of FJ cells39. Thus, the BJ design allows the losses associated with the front surface to be reduced, especially when combined with a highly transparent front surface. Therefore, we investigated such BJ cells, which included a systematic compari- son with FJ cells. BJ cells are more sensitive to the electrical quality of the c-Si bulk material than FJ cells, because the minority charge carriers are collected at the back surface, whereas most of the charge carriers are generated close to the front surface40. To focus this study mainly on fundamental and design aspects and less on aspects related to material quality, we mainly considered high-quality float-zone (FZ) c-Si materials. TOPCon BJ solar cells To realize BJ cells with the TOPCon technology, we applied the design of the n-type Si FJ TOPCon (n-FJ) cell (Fig. 2d) to a p-type c-Si wafer (Fig. 2e). In this configuration, the TOPCon at the back acts as a full-area contacted pn junction, which, in contrast to the n-FJ cell, makes lateral current transport in the emitter obsolete. The full-area boron diffusion at the front surface was omitted, as a promising performance was predicted41 especially for these TOPCon rear emitter (TOPCoRE) cells without lateral conductiv- ity in a front surface field (FSF)39. However, a heavy boron diffusion is located below the directly metallized front contacts to reduce surface recombination losses and to form the contact. These p-type Si TOPCon BJ (p-BJ) cells were fabricated on FZ wafers with two different bulk resistivities ρb and with two different front metal contact pitches. The currentvoltage (IV) parameters of these cells are summa- rized in Fig. 3 together with the results of the n-FJ cells. Table 1 reports independently confirmed IV parameters of the best cells per variation. The p-BJ cells show a very high open circuit voltage (VOC) with values up to 732 mV, quite similar for both c-Si bulk resis- tivities. This is more than 5 mV higher than those for the n-FJ cells, which reveals the gain of omitting the full-area boron diffusion at the front surface. The fill factor (FF) of the 1 Ω cm p-BJ cells of up to 84.5% is almost 1% absolute (%abs) higher than that of the n-FJ cells. This demonstrates the high passivation quality of Al2O3 at the front surface and TOPCon at the back surface, as well as a sufficiently high hole conductivity in the c-Si bulk towards the local front contacts, even without any laterally conductive layer at the front surface. The FF of the 10 Ω cm p-BJ cells is more than 2%abs lower than that of the 1 Ω cm p-BJ cells. This indicates quite serious resistive losses, and hence, the sensitivity of the p-BJ cell design to the hole conductivity in the c-Si bulk. The short-circuit current density (JSC), in contrast, is lowest for the 1 Ω cm p-BJ (42.1 mA cm2), as both the n-FJ cell and the 10 Ω cm p-BJ cell show values around 42.5 mA cm2. Such a significant decrease of 0.4 mA cm2 observed for the p-BJ cells with decreasing ρb was already predicted39 and also reported for other BJ solar cells40,42. The effect can also be observed in the slightly decreasing external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the 1 Ω cm p-BJ with decreasing wavelength (Supplementary Fig. 1). Altogether, the 1 Ω cm p-BJ cells showed the highest conversion efficiency (26.0%) compared with the 10 Ω cm p-BJ cells (25.5%) and the n-FJ cells (25.8%). This high conversion efficiency of the 1 Ω cm p-BJ cell represents one of the highest values for both-sides-contacted sili- con solar cells and the very high electrical performance of this cell reduces the gap to the SHJ cells (Fig. 1e). Power loss analysis For a deeper understanding of the non-trivial current transport and recombination losses in these non-standard cell designs, we performed a systematic power loss analysis (PLA) of all the elec- trical and optical mechanisms based on the free energy loss analy- sis43 (FELA). With this approach, transport losses, recombination losses and optical losses become directly comparable. In FELA, the free energy generated by an absorbed photon equals the local quasi-Fermi level (QFL) splitting at maximum power point (MPP) condition. The power losses associated with the different electrical loss mechanisms were derived by considering, for example, their local conductivity or recombination rate. As such, FELA is to some extent similar to a calculation of the electrical (resistive) power losses (mW cm2) and a calculation of the optical as well as the recombination power losses by multiplying the respective charge carrier current densities (mA cm2) with the internal voltage at MPP, VMPP, which again results in power loss (mW cm2).

Nature Energy | VOL 6 | April 2021 | 429438 | www.nature.com/natureenergy 431 Articles NATure Energy fabricated cells is smaller than the theoretical limit, the FELA does not sum all the losses to the fundamental efficiency limit of 29.4%, but rather to the absorbed free energy, which is proportional to the QFL splitting at the MPP. Thus, it represents the power losses for a certain cell with its individual MPP performance characteristic and its individual MPP QFL splitting distribution. The electrical FELA directly resulted from carefully calibrated three-dimensional (3D) full-area device simulations using the solar cell simulator Quokka34,44,45, and the optical PLA was calcu- lated from the measured EQE and reflectance R. Figure 4c shows the resulting PLA together with the simulated output power for the best cells per variation in units of mW cm2, which is equivalent to a conversion efficiency in %. Figure 4a,b shows VMPP as a measure for the global QFL splitting (Fig. 4b), and the ratio of excess charge carrier density at MPP (ΔnMPP) and the c-Si bulk doping concentra- tion (Ndop), ΔnMPP/Ndop, as a measure of the charge carrier injection level (Fig. 4a). Concerning the optical losses, the p-BJ cells exhibit a 0.3%abs higher loss from front surface shading and reflection than the n-FJ cell, which is due to a non-perfect antireflection coating (ARC) and metal grid, that is, losses that can be avoided technologi- cally. The non-ideal front losses are highest for the 1 Ω cm p-BJ cell, which can be attributed to the effect that causes the low JSC of this cell mentioned in the previous section. The non-ideal back losses, which describe mainly the light-trapping quality and the parasitic absorption at the back metal contact, are very similar for all the cells due to the identical cell design at the back surface. Concerning the electrical losses, the c-Si bulk recombination losses are dominated by Auger recombination, which is most pronounced for the 1 Ω cm p-BJ cell, as it increases with increasing c-Si bulk doping concentra- tion Ndop. The surface recombination losses of all the cells are domi- nated by the front surface, which are lowest for the 1 Ω cm p-BJ cell, especially in the non-contacted area. The 10 Ω cm p-BJ cell shows a significantly higher loss at the front surface and at the TOPCon back surface due to the slightly lower surface passivation quality observed on this cell, most likely caused by non-perfect processing. The most pronounced differences in this PLA can be obtained, however, for the current transport losses, which notably comprise both resistive and diffusive transport losses: the n-FJ cell as well as the 10 Ω cm p-BJ cell are dominated by the hole transport losses towards the local front contacts either in the front conductive layer (that is, the p+ emitter of the n-FJ cell) or in the c-Si bulk of the p-BJ cell. In contrast, the electron and hole transport losses in the 1 Ω cm p-BJ are balanced and in total significantly lower, although no full-area laterally conductive layer at the front surface is present. Note that the accumulation layer induced at the front surface of p-BJ cells by fixed negative charges of the Al2O3 surface passivation layer results in a very high sheet resistance of 15 kΩ sq1 (ref. 46), and thus plays practically no role. Especially, the 10 Ω cm p-BJ cell exhibits a quite high hole transport loss, which confirms the strong sensitivity of the p-BJ design on the hole conductivity in the c-Si bulk. This reveals also that the conductivity modulation47,48the effect that the conductivity in silicon increases under illuminationdoes not sufficiently increase the hole conductivity at this high ΔnMPP with a ΔnMPP/Ndop ratio of 1.7. The ratio improves to some extent if the device performance increases, for instance, by reducing the surface recombination, because this results in an increase of ΔnMPP and con- sequently of the hole conductivity as well39. This effect also explains the strong FF scattering observed for the 10 Ω cm p-BJ cells (Fig. 3), as it is found to correlate quite well with the VMPP scattering and hence with ΔnMPP. Finally, all the cells exhibit rather substantial losses due to the dark perimeter, the silicon wafer region outside the active cell area, which are most pronounced for the 10 Ω cm p-BJ cell, but are, with 0.3%abs, also quite severe for the 1 Ω cm p-BJ cell. If these edge losses can be omitted, for instance, by increasing the active area of the solar cell, and if the better front side optic (better metal grid and ARC) of the n-FJ cell are assumed, the device simulation pre- dicts an efficiency potential of 26.6% for this 1 Ω cm p-BJ cell. An improvement of the light trapping, as discussed for the n-FJ cell elsewhere19, might have some further improvement potential for this p-BJ cell. 26.5 85 43.0 42.5 42.0 41.5 41.0 735 730 725 720 715 84 83 82 81 80 79 P = 833 µm P = 1,000 µm 26.0 25.5 25.0 Efficiency (%) FF (%) VOC (mV) JSC (mA cm2) 24.5 24.0 n-FJ p-BJ(1) p-BJ(10) n-FJ p-BJ(1) p-BJ(10) n-FJ p-BJ(1) p-BJ(10) n-FJ p-BJ(1) p-BJ(10) Fig. 3 | 1-sun IV parameters (in-house measurements) of all the fabricated solar cells. n-FJ represents the FJ TOPCon cells made of 200 µm thick 1 Ω cm n-type FZ Si with a full-area boron-doped p+ emitter (sheet resistance Rsheet,p+ = 300 Ω sq1), as shown in Fig. 2d, and p-BJ(1) and p-BJ(10) represent the TOPCon BJ cells without a full-area boron-doped front surface made of 250 µm thick 1 Ω cm and 10 Ω cm p-type FZ Si, respectively (Fig. 2e).

Nature Energy | VOL 6 | April 2021 | 429438 | www.nature.com/natureenergy 432 Articles NATure Energy Comparison between FJs and BJs In this section, a more systematic comparison of FJ and BJ solar cells is provided to identify an ultimate design for FBC solar cells. Therefore, we performed Quokka3 simulations based on the con- figuration used for the PLA, but for a 3D unit cell of a large area cell with the better front side reflectance of the n-FJ cell. Thereby, edge losses (that is, by the perimeter region) and the avoidable optical losses of the fabricated p-BJ cells are omitted and hence the full potential of these cells is explored, especially for the p-BJ cells. In a first simulation, the conductivity of the front surface was varied systematically, applying an empirical parameterization of the measured surface recombination in the form of J0,FS as a function of its sheet resistance, Rsheet,FS (Supplementary Fig. 5). Figure 5 shows the resulting power output for n-FJ and p-BJ cells with ρb values of 1 and 10 Ω cm, together with the electrical PLA and the ΔnMPP/Ndop ratio. The decreasing surface recombination with increasing Rsheet,FS results for all the cells in a decreasing power loss at the front surface. This performance gain is partially compensated by increasing bulk recombination losses with increasing performance. The increas- ing Rsheet,FS also provokes increasing hole transport losses in the c-Si bulk. These losses are most pronounced for the 1 Ω cm n-FJ cell, in which they cause a severe performance reduction at a high Rsheet,FS. This limited hole transport is also the reason for the increasing recombination losses, in particular of the Auger recombination in this cell at a high Rsheet,FS. The hole transport losses are only slightly less pronounced for the 10 Ω cm n-FJ and 10 Ω cm p-BJ cells, which shows that the increase in the hole conductivity due to conductiv- ity modulation is not high enough, although in particular the n-FJ cell operates in high-injection conditions (a ΔnMPP/Ndop ratio close to 10). In contrast, the hole transport losses of the 1 Ω cm p-BJ cell are comparably small compared with the electron transport losses, even at a very high Rsheet,FS, and therefore almost no performance reduction is observed. This is because electron and hole transport losses are balanced as well as the transport and surface recombi- nation losses in general. As such, these results reveal the superior performance of the 1 Ω cm p-BJ cell at a high Rsheet,FS, that is, with- out a full-area diffused front surface, and the importance of a high majority carrier conductivity for the BJ cell design. Concerning the absolute efficiency potential, the 10 Ω cm n-FJ and 10 Ω cm p-BJ cells show a similar performance to that of the 1 Ω cm p-BJ cell, but only for a narrow Rsheet,FS range around 1,000 Ω sq1, that is, with a full-area diffused front surface. The experimental and theoretical investigations described so far were carried out for an n-type TOPCon contact at the back, which results in hole transport towards the local front contacts being a major limiting effect for performance optimization. However, elec- trons exhibit an about three times higher mobility than holes in c-Si. Thus, the question arises whether a device with opposite polarities, that is, electron transport towards the front contacts, fundamen- tally changes the loss balance towards enabling a higher device performance. To answer this question, we performed equivalent 3D device simulations for the FJ and BJ designs of both polarities with (Rsheet,FS = 300 Ω sq1) and without (Rsheet,FS = 16.5 kΩ sq1) a diffused front surface, otherwise assuming identical device properties. The simulation results are shown in Fig. 6 as a function of ρb, analo- gously to those in Fig. 5. As expected, a lower current transport loss is observed if it is dominated by an electron current transport due to the higher mobil- ity. In the case of the FJ cells without a conductive front surface, for instance, the current transport losses are dominated by the minor- ity charge carrier transport towards the local front contacts, which results in a significantly lower power loss for the p-FJ cell without n+ because here the minority charge carriers are electrons. A simi- lar trend can also be observed for the BJ cells with a high ρb, but for the opposite c-Si doping polarity, because the current transport losses are dominated here by the majority charge carrier transport towards the local front contacts. This effect is almost not visible for the FJ cells with a conductive front surface (that is, n-FJ with p+ and p-FJ with n+) because the minority charge carrier transport to the local front contacts is strongly supported by the conductive front surface. Altogether, the p-FJ cell without n+ and the n-BJ cell exhibit the highest performance due to the higher electron mobility, but only for a high-resistivity c-Si wafer.

The electrical power losses result from the 3D full-area device simulations performed with Quokka344,45. The optical power losses, as evaluated from measured EQE and reflectance data, are separated into three contributions: the front surface shading and reflection losses, the losses due to a non-ideal front (absorption in the front coatings and front recombination) and a non-ideal back (surface recombination, absorption at the back metal contact, free carrier absorption and non-ideal light-trapping).

Nature Energy | VOL 6 | April 2021 | 429438 | www.nature.com/natureenergy 433 Articles NATure Energy such high-resistivity c-Si can be more prone to charge carrier life- time limitations4. For practical doping levels of ρb of 2 Ω cm, it is the p-BJ cells that show a slightly higher performance mainly due to strongly reduced hole transport losses. This shows that the higher mobility of electrons is not necessarily a fundamental advantage, as found, for example, in earlier studies for SHJ BJ cells49. It depends on the specific cell design. So far, the analysis has mainly focused on design-related aspects given the high electrical quality of the c-Si bulk material in the form of FZ Si. In PV mass production, however, Czochralski-grown (Cz) Si is the standard monocrystalline material, which usually has a lower electrical quality than that of FZ Si due to a higher concentra- tion of common metal impurities and oxygen. The latter especially affects B-doped p-type Si due to the light-induced degradation caused by BO defects50,51. However, there are different approaches to strongly prevent light-induced degradation in p-type Cz Si, for instance, by using magnetic Cz Si, which reduces the amount of oxygen in the material52, by using Ga-doped p-type Cz Si, as Ga forms no recombination-active defects with oxygen52,53, or by elimi- nating the BO defects in B-doped p-type Cz Si by a combination of an optical and thermal treatment54 even at a high throughput5557. Simulation results for the p-BJ without p+ (TOPCoRE cell, Fig. 2e) and the n-FJ with p+ (Fig. 2d) as a function of the electrical c-Si bulk quality indicate that the p-BJ cells outperform the n-FJ cells if the impurity-related minority charge carrier lifetime limitation for 1 Ω cm p-type Cz Si reaches values above 2 ms (Supplementary Fig. 6). With the continuous progress seen over the recent years in electrical material quality, measured lifetime values on p-type Cz Si are already close to this level58, which indicates that the quality of the p-type Cz Si does not necessarily limit the device performance of the TOPCoRE cell significantly. Conclusions All FBC high-performing c-Si solar cells of the past 30 years feature a FJ cell design. In this study, we demonstrate experimentally an efficiency up to 26% with a p-type c-Si BJ solar cell, which features n-type c-Si (1 Ω cm) n-TOPCon p+ emitter n-TOPCon p-type c-Si (1 Ω cm) n-TOPCon p-type c-Si (10 Ω cm) p-BJ (10 Ω cm) 25 26 27 28 29 Rsheet,FS (Ω sq1) Power output and power loss (mW cm2) Power output n-FJ (1 Ω cm) n-FJ (10 Ω cm) 100 1,000 10,000 Rsheet,FS (Ω sq1) 100 1,000 10,000 Rsheet,FS (Ω sq1) 100 1,000 10,000 Rsheet,FS (Ω sq1) 100 1,000 10,000 p-BJ (1 Ω cm) 0.01 0.1 1 10 d c b a h g f e l k j i c-Si bulk recombination Auger Radiative SRH Surface recombination Front contact Front non-contacted Rear (TOPCon) Current transport Front grid Front contact Front conductive layer Rear contact Si bulk holes Si bulk electrons p+ emitter p++ FSF n-type c-Si (10 Ω cm) ΔnMPP/Ndop Fig. 5 | Influence of front surface conductivity on the device performance. ad, Schematic cross-sections of the simulated solar cells. n-type FJ cells with a full-area p+ front emitter and c-Si bulk resistivities of 1 Ω cm (a) or 10 Ω cm (b) as well as p-type BJ cells without a full-area p+ FSF and c-Si bulk resistivities of 1 Ω cm (c) or 10 Ω cm (d). eh, Average ΔnMPP normalized to Ndop (logarithmic scale) for the simulations shown in il. il, Electrical PLA and power output resulting from device simulations for n-type FJ cells in a,b and the p-type BJ cells in c,d. The power is plotted as a function of the lateral conductivity at the front surface in form of Rsheet,FS (logarithmic scale). The device simulations were performed for a 3D unit cell of a large area cell with a multiwire front contact grid design70 (Supplementary Fig. 4) without considering shunt, edge and busbar losses. The vertical grey bars in el indicate the sheet resistivity range induced by the fixed negative charges of the Al2O3 front surface passivation, Rsheet,induced, as measured in Werner et al.46. The grey areas around ΔnMPP/Ndop in eh indicate the ΔnMPP distribution over the whole cell. This distribution is significantly increased for the 1 Ω cm n-FJ cell at high Rsheet,FS due to the limited hole transport. This causes a strongly increased ΔnMPP in the area between the front metal contacts and consequently also a strong increase of recombination losses, in particular of the Auger recombination in this cell. Note that the reported power (mW cm2) is equivalent to efficiency (%). Nature Energy | VOL 6 | April 2021 | 429438 | www.nature.com/natureenergy 434 Articles NATure Energy a full-area passivating contact based on our TOPCon technology at the back surface and a highly transparent front surface based on dielectric passivation layers. The very high FF (84.3%) of this cell, achieved without any full-area conductive layers at the front sur- face, proves the very effective charge carrier transport in the c-Si bulk to the local front-side contacts. This device performance rep- resents the highest efficiency reported for FBC c-Si solar cells. This result may open a path to higher-performance FBC c-Si solar cells, as we have shown that no lateral transport layer is necessary for high-performance BJ-FBC solar cells, which means, for instance, that no TCO is needed at the front side of such solar cells. To study the performance characteristic of this p-BJ cell design in depth from a more general point of view, a systematic simulation-based analysis was performed for a variety of different solar cell designs, which led to some fundamental design rules for future 26% efficiency c-Si solar cells. First, the BJ cell design is the key to omit a conductive front surface layer because the lateral current transport to the local front contacts is very effectively pro- vided in the c-Si wafer, as it is a majority carrier transport with its inherent high conductivity. Second, on the choice of the c-Si dopant polarity, it appears that the fundamental advantage of an n-BJ due to the higher electron conductivity in c-Si is rather small and actu- ally only present at a lowly doped c-Si (ρb  2 Ω cm). Third, as to the c-Si doping concentration, cells made of moderately doped c-Si are typically less prone to c-Si bulk lifetime limitations4. For such moderately doped c-Si (ρb  2 Ω cm), it is actually the p-BJ design that shows a slightly superior performance due to a very effective balancing of recombination and transport losses. As such, this study demonstrates the potential of these BJ solar cells as a candidate for future c-Si solar cells with efficiencies in the range of 27%, which are expected to play an important role in the next decade, before multijunction solar cell concepts, such as IIIV//Si semiconductors59 and, in particular, perovskite/silicon6062 tandem structures with efficiency potentials beyond 30%, might dominate the PV mass production of utility-scale solar systems22,29,63. Methods Solar cell fabrication. The n-FJ and p-BJ solar cells fabricated in this study have a designated illumination area of 2  2 cm2 and were made of high-quality (100)-oriented FZ Si wafers (Siltronic AG) with a diameter of 100 mm.

The device simulations were performed for the same unit cells as used for the simulation results in Fig. 5. For the p+ diffused surface, the properties of the 300 Ω sq1 emitter of the fabricated solar cells were assumed. For the simulations without a diffused surface, the very high front surface sheet resistance of Rsheet,FS = 16.5 kΩ sq1 for the Al2O3-induced accumulation layer was assumed. For the sake of comparability, the properties (surface recombination and conductivity) of the n+ diffused surface and p-type TOPCon (for p-FJ and n-BJ) were assumed to be the same as for those for the p+ diffused surface and n-type TOPCon, respectively. The grey range around ΔnMPP/Ndop (gl) indicates the ΔnMPP distribution over the whole cell. This distribution is significantly increased for the FJ cells without a conductive front surface (that is, n-FJ without p+ and p-FJ without n+) at low ρb due to the strongly varying ΔnMPP over the cell area. This is the reason for the strong increase of recombination losses, in particular of the Auger recombination in these cells at low ρb. Nature Energy | VOL 6 | April 2021 | 429438 | www.nature.com/natureenergy 435 Articles NATure Energy n-FJ cells were made of 200-µm-thick 1 Ω cm Si wafers and the p-BJ cells were made of 250-µm-thick 1 Ω cm and 10 Ω cm Si wafers. As the fabrication sequence of the n-FJ and the p-BJ cells is very similar, the fabrication of both is described together. The front side of the solar cells featured an alkaline-etched random-pyramid textured surface. The front surface of the n-FJ cells exhibited a boron-doped p+ emitter, which was formed by BBr3 diffusion at 870 C in a tube furnace (centrotherm) followed by a drive-in oxidation at 1,050 C. This diffusion resulted in a sheet resistance of Rsheet,p+ = 300 Ω sq1  10%. This emitter of the n-FJ cells as well as the bare c-Si surface of the p-BJ cells was passivated with a 10-nm-thick Al2O3 layer deposited with plasma-assisted atomic layer deposition (OpAL, Oxford Instruments) at a deposition temperature of 180 C. The front side was additionally coated with a double-layer antireflection coating that consisted of 50 nm SiNx grown by plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition (MAiA, Meyer Burger) and 90-nm-thick thermally evaporated MgF2. Prior to the MgF2 deposition, contact openings were wet-chemically etched through the front side Al2O3/SiNx coating with a buffered oxide etch and the front side metal contacts were formed with a stack of electron-beam evaporated Ti/Pd/Ag. To reduce the surface recombination losses at the front metal contacts, a heavily doped p++ emitter was located underneath the contacts, which was also diffused in a BBr3 tube furnace process at 850 C and a subsequent inert drive-in in Ar followed by a drive-in oxidation. The full-area TOPCon electron contact on the rear surface was formed by an ultrathin SiOx layer grown in a thermal oxidation process, which was covered by a 15-nm-thick phosphorous-doped Si thin film deposited with a plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition system (AK400, Roth&Rau), and which was annealed afterwards in a tube furnace at 900 C. To separate the TOPCon emitter of the seven p-BJ cells on one wafer, the TOPCon stack at the rear surface was etched in between the cells via a plasma etch process (ICP133, Oxford Instruments). This bare c-Si rear surface between the cells was passivated with 10 nm Al2O3 synthesized via plasma-assisted atomic layer deposition capped by 120 nm plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposited SiOx. Prior to the rear-side metallization, a forming gas anneal (H2/N2) was performed in a tube furnace for 25 min at 425 C to activate the Al2O3 surface passivation and, in the case of the p-BJ cells, the Al2O3/SiOx stack was etched back on the cell area in a buffered oxide etch. The rear-side contact was realized by thermal evaporation of 1 µm Ag. All the structuring processes required for the front side and rear side were based on photolithography (partially to structure thermally grown SiO2 mask layers) and the lift-off technique. Electrical characterization of the solar cells. The in-house 1-sun current-voltage (IV) parameters of the solar cells were measured under standard testing conditions (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm2, 25 C) using a sun simulator with a current calibration based on certified IV measurements (Fraunhofer ISE CalLab, see the certificated measurement results in Supplementary Figs. 7 and 8). The solar cells were measured using an aperture of 2  2 cm2 on a designated area of the solar cell without cutting the cell out of the 100 mm (diameter) wafer. The EQE and reflectance R were measured on the full device area with the LOANA system from PV Tools. Optical PLA. The optical PLA was determined from the measured EQE and reflectance R data by evaluating the JSC losses with respect to the ideal Lambertian light trapping64. The total reflectance was separated into the front surface reflectance Rsurf and the escape reflectance Resc by a linear fit of R around 900950 nm and extrapolated to longer wavelengths. The difference of 1  Rsurf and EQE gives the non-ideal front surface (absorption in front coatings and front recombination) and the non-ideal rear surface losses (rear recombination, absorption at the rear metal contact, free carrier absorption and non-ideal light trapping), which were separated at a wavelength of 900 nm. Note that in this notation, the non-ideal rear surface losses include the escape reflection losses. All losses were weighted with the Lambertian light-trapping absorptance65 as a benchmark for ideal light trapping (Supplementary Fig. 2). The current losses of each optical loss mechanism were calculated via integration over the AM 1.5G photon flux density. To obtain an optical power loss, the resulting current losses were multiplied with the experimentally determined maximum power point voltage VMPP as a measure for the global QFL splitting in accordance with the electrical FELA. Simulation set-up for the PLA of fabricated solar cells. The electrical FELA results from device simulations performed with Quokka344,45, a solar cell simulation tool that features the lumped skin/conductive boundary approach66 in which the surfaces can be defined by recombination parameters J0 and sheet resistances Rsheet. To have a complete realistic model, one-quarter of the fabricated solar cells (that is, a 1  1 cm2 active area) as well as the dark perimeter outside the active cell area (Supplementary Fig. 3), was simulated in 3D and thereby all the lateral effects and edge losses were considered. Almost all the simulation input parameters were determined experimentally, for example, with effective lifetime measurements at symmetrically processed lifetime samples (with an Al2O3-passivated p+ emitter or TOPCon on n-type Si) for the J0 value extraction, or with four-point probe measurements for the Rsheet values. The optical model was based on lumped parameters, that is, a wavelength-dependent front-surface transmission, which was extracted from the measured reflectance data, and a parameterization of the pathlength enhancement Z, which was used from ref. 4. For all simulations, a SRH recombination67,68 in the c-Si bulk was considered by using the recombination properties of interstitial Fe69, which we identified in our labs as one potential source of contamination. Further details of the simulation setup and the respective measurements are described in Richter et al.4. To calibrate the model to the measured IV parameters, three parameters were varied slightly: the recombination properties of the passivated front surface and the TOPCon passivated rear surface (that is, J0,VS,pass and J0,TOPCon), as well as the SRH defect density NFe. J0,VS,pass and J0,TOPCon were varied only in a narrow range within the measurement uncertainty and the typical variation from experiment to experiment. The main input parameters for the simulations are listed in Supplementary Table 1. The simulated IV parameters are in very good agreement with the measured parameters (Supplementary Table 2), which indicates that the models provide an accurate description of the fabricated cells. Simulation set-up for general design analysis. For the simulation results shown in Figs. 5 and 6, we also performed 3D device simulations with Quokka3, which were mainly based on the design of the experimentally fabricated solar cells, that is, the simulation set-up used for the FELA. Instead of the full-area simulations, we used a 3D unit cell of a hypothetical large-area cell with a multiwire front-contact metal grid design70 with a finger pitch of 1,000 µm and wire pitch of 12 mm (Supplementary Fig. 4). For these simulations, we assumed shunt, edge (that is, by the perimeter region) and busbar losses to be negligible. In addition, we used the better front-side optic (ARC and metal grid shading) of the fabricated n-FJ cell for all the simulated cells. For the simulations shown in Fig. 5, we used an empirical parameterization of the front surface recombination in the form of J0,FS as a function of Rsheet,FS (Supplementary Fig. 5), which was derived from experimental results19,39,71. The details of the simulated solar cells in Fig. 6 are given in Supplementary Table 3. Reporting Summary.
