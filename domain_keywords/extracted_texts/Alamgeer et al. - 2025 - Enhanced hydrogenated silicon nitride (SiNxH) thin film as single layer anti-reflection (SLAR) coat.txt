Focusing on the SiNx:H thin film, our research explores the effects of varying flow rates to achieve an ideal balance between surface passivation and anti-reflective properties. The optimized SiNx:H layer deposited with an NH3/SiH4 flow rate of 1.3 exhibits a refractive index of 2.04 and a carrier lifetime of 625 μs reflecting an excellent passivation quality.

Furthermore, an implied open-circuit voltage (iVoc) of 714 mV contributes to an overall efficiency of 22.84 % of TOPCon solar cell, underscoring the critical role of fine-tuned SiNx:H deposition in minimizing recombination losses. Through this approach, we demonstrate the targeted flow rate adjustments can significantly influence SiNx:H properties, driving improvements in the passivation and optical performance essential for advancing high-efficiency TOPCon solar cells. 1. Introduction Hydrogenated Silicon nitride (SiNx:H) thin films play a crucial role in modern solar cell technology, serving as antireflection layer to enhance device efficiency [1]. SiNx:H coatings significantly reduce surface reflectionover 35 % of incident light would typically reflect off an untreated silicon surface, but with SiNx:H, this light can be effectively trapped, increasing photon absorption and energy conversion [2]. Additionally, during the plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) process, SiNx:H films introduce atomic hydrogen into the sili con. This atomic hydrogen diffuses into the silicon lattice, passivating bulk and surface defects, which reduces electron-hole recombination and subsequently enhances overall efficiency [3,4]. Furthermore, SiNx: H layers exhibit particularly low surface recombination velocities on phosphorus-diffused emitters and silicon wafers, making them highly effective for advanced passivation. These properties have established SiNx:H as a preferred material for enhancing light management and carrier lifetime in high-efficiency photovoltaic cells [5]. SiNx:H layers serve as a key hydrogen source for enhancing the performance of solar cell by improving defect passivation. However, during thermal treatment, hydrogen atoms diffuse from the SiNx:H layer into the silicon bulk, where they interact with and neutralize defect states and impurities [6,7]. Two primary mechanisms describe hydrogen desorption from SiNx:H: diffusion of atomic hydrogen and molecular hydrogen release. Benoit et al. [8]., indicate that hydrogen desorption occurs mainly through dissociation reactions, where breaking Si-H and Si-N bonds releases H2 and forms new Si-Si or Si-N bonds. This process is observed by analyzing bond structures and comparing mass before and after annealing. The bonding configuration in SiNx:H thus indicates its hydrogen release capacity, while its mass density also plays a crucial * Corresponding author.

Low-density SiNx:H films (2.5 g/cm3) allow for substantial hydrogen release (over 1  1017 atoms/cm2) and have higher hydrogen permeability, whereas denser films (2.5 g/cm3) act as hydrogen bar riers, restricting diffusion [9]. Tunnel Oxide Passivated Contact (TOPCon) technology has signifi cantly advanced solar cell efficiency, primarily by integrating an ultra- thin oxide and doped poly-Si is on rear-side of TOPCon solar cells which enhances carrier selectivity and reduce recombination losses [10]. SiNx on TOPCon mostly act as an anti-reflection coating, however, front side passivation is provided by AlOx and rear-side SiNx is mostly used for atomic hydrogenation and barrier layer for fire-though metal lization. Although challenges remain in reducing parasitic absorption on the cell, recent material and design innovations including optimized SiNx:H layer, continue to push efficiency limits making TOPCon a leading approach in high-efficiency solar cells [11,12]. The passivation quality of polysilicon passivating contacts often deteriorates during the high-temperature firing required for metallization [13]. To counteract this, a hydrogen-rich SiNx layer is typically applied as a protective film, which helps maintain passivation quality by minimizing degradation. The hydrogen in SiNx enhances overall passivation, a benefit well-supported by research. Studies show that a high hydrogen con centration near the ultrathin oxide layerachieved through hydroge nation or similar techniquessignificantly improves passivation, leading to better electrical performance and efficiency in TOPCon solar cells [1416]. In this study, our primary goal was to optimize the SiNx:H thin film layer in TOPCon solar cells to improve overall passivation quality. This optimization aims to achieve excellent surface passivation, reduce recombination losses, and provide a significant anti-reflective effect. An optimized flow rate of NH3/SiH4 at 1.3 yielded a front layer with a lifetime of 734 μs and a refractive index of 2.05, which is ideal for a single-layer anti-reflection coating. Furthermore, an implied open- circuit voltage (iVoc) of 714 mV was achieved, positively impacting the performance of n-TOPCon cells. This improvement contributed to an overall efficiency enhancement of 22.11 %, demonstrating the critical role of SiNx:H enhanced passivation quality in further optimizing TOP Con solar cell conversion efficiency. 2. Experimental details 2.1. SiNx:H optimization for n-TOPCon The key fabrication includes the optimization of SiNx:H thin films layer for single layer anti-reflection coating SLAR in n-TOPCon solar cell. For this purpose, a Czochralski (CZ) n-type semigrad silicon wafers with resistivity 0.003 Ω cm and a (111) crystal orientation, cut into 2  2 cm sections. For lifetime assessments, LONGI n-type (100) phosphorus-doped wafers, cut into 4  4 cm sections with a resistivity between 1 Ω cm, were used with SiNx:H deposited on both sides. Surface contamination on the semigrad and solar grade wafer was removed through immersion in 300 ml each of acetone, ethanol, and deionized water (DIW) solutions, with ultrasonic cleaning for 5 min in each solvent. After that, solar grade wafer for n-TOPCon solar cell fabrication were further cleaned using Radio Corporation of America (RCA) method which began with saw damage removal using a hot (75 C) KOH solution (20 % wt., 85 % purity) for 9 min. After that semigrade and solar-grade wafers together underwent a 10 % hydro fluoric acid (HF) treatment for 2 min at room temperature to remove the native oxide layer from the wafer surfaces. The samples were then rinsed in DIW for 2 min and dried using nitrogen gas. The SiNx:H deposition was carried out in a PECVD reactor operating at a plasma frequency of 13.56 MHz, with an atmosphere of argon and NH3 gases (99.99999 % purity) at a substrate temperature of 300 C, under a working pressure of 0.97 Torr, and a power setting of 300 mW/cm2. 2.2. n-TOPCon solar cell fabrication The TOPCon device was fabricated using low-resistivity (1 Ω cm) phosphorous-doped n-type (100) monocrystalline Czochralski (CZ) wafers, cut into 4  4 cm2 sections. Following cleaning, boron diffusion was used on the front-textured surface to form a p+ emitter with a sheet resistance of 120 Ω/sq. A 1.4 nm SiO2 tunnel oxide layer was thermally grown on the rear flat surface at 700 C for 15 min in an oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere. An approximately 80 nm phosphorus-doped amorphous silicon (n+-a-Si) layer was deposited on tunnel oxide using PECVD with SiH4, H2, and PH3 gases at 250 C, 0.2 Torr, and 55 mW/cm2. Thermal annealing at 890 C in a nitrogen atmosphere transformed this into an n+-poly-Si passivating contact. For surface passivation, an 8 nm Al2O3 and 775 nm SiNx stack was applied to the front, and an 755 nm SiNx layer was added to the rear using PECVD with Ar, SiH4, and NH3 gases at 300 C, 0.97 Torr, and 300 mW/cm2. The device was finalized with screen-printed front and rear metallization. Additional fabrication details can be found in Ref. [17]. The refractive index and thickness of the SiNx films were analyzed using an ellipsometer (EllisoTech Elli-SE-U). To assess passivation quality, including minority carrier lifetime (τ) and implied open-circuit voltage (iVoc), a photoconductance lifetime tester (Sinton WCT-120) was used. FTIR spectra of the SiNx films at different flow rates were measured in ATR mode with the IRPrestige-21 (Shimadzu) system, providing hydrogen content data for calculating hydrogen concentra tion. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was evaluated using a PV Measurements QEX7 system. Device performance was tested with a Keithley 2400 I-V measurement system under AM1.5G standard illu mination (100 mW/cm2, 25 C), which also enabled dark current- voltage (DIV) measurements. 3. Results and discussion SiNx:H thin films deposited with varying flow rates exhibited notable variations in both refractive index and deposition rate, as shown in Fig. 1 (a). The refractive index ranged from 2.51 to 1.95, while the deposition rates varied between 0.68 and 1.15 nm/s. Increasing the flow of NH3 led to a higher deposition rate and a significant reduction in refractive index, particularly when the GR was below 2. This occurs because the dissociation rate of NH3 surpasses that of SiH4 at different flow rates, resulting in films with higher nitrogen content, characterized by a lower refractive index due to an increased presence of NH bonds. In contrast, the higher deposition rate is linked to a reduced concentration of SiH Fig. 1. The refractive index and deposition rate of SiNx:H thin films vary with changes in the NH3/SiH4 gas flow ratio. This ratio is adjusted by modifying the NH3 flow rate while keeping the SiH4 flow constant. Alamgeer et al. Materials Science in Semiconductor Processing 192 (2025) 109483 2 bonds. As NH3 flow increases (with SiH4 kept constant), there is a ten dency for the film thickness to rise, which is attributed to the enhanced incorporation of nitrogen into the film. This is facilitated by the greater availability of NH3 in the deposition environment, which becomes more dynamic and promotes thicker film formation. The deposition rate also increases with SiH4 flow due to the higher concentration of radicals generated in the plasma. In addition, nitrogen being a reactant that contributes to the growth of the SiNx:H network, may also influence the chemical kinetics of the deposition process, leading to faster material deposition [18]. The optimized flow rate of NH3/SiH4 was found to be 1.3, yielding a refractive index of 2.04 and a film thickness of approxi mately 77.55 nm. As the NH3/SiH4 gas flow ratio increases, the optical transmittance of the SiNx:H film also rises, as shown in Fig. 2(a). Specifically, a trans mittance of over 96.12 % is achieved at a flow ratio above 1.3, corre sponding to a refractive index of 2.04. This enhancement in transmittance is attributed to the reduction of SiH bonds, which absorb light in the visible spectrum. Such characteristics make SiNx:H films valuable for applications requiring efficient light management, such as solar cell light trapping. At a gas ratio (GR) of 1.3, the SiNx:H film achieves an optimal balance between density and transparency, making it ideal for single-layer anti-reflective (SLAR) coatings in photovoltaic devices. Fig. 2(b) illustrates the extinction coefficient (k) of SiNx:H films at various refractive indices (RI = 1.95, 1.97, 2.04, 2.20 and 2.51) across different wavelengths. For SiNx:H films k peaks at 250 nm (UV range) and declines progressively up to 350 nm consistent with materials exhibiting strong UV absorption due to electronic transitions across their bandgap. This spectral dependency is consistent with the SiNx:H band structure where higher-energy UV photons spark interband transitions while lower-energy visible photons cause poorer absorption. Among varied GR 0.5 produces the greatest k values indicating increased optical density from thicker or structurally denser sheets. In contrast, GR 2.0 correlates to a lower k implying reduced absorption due to thinner or less dense film morphologies. The inverse correlation between GR and k implies deposition parameters critically influence film microstructure and optical performance. The SiNx:H film demonstrates strong UV absorption at shorter wavelengths (around 250 nm), effectively shielding underlying layers from potential UV damage. As shown in Fig. 2(c), this absorption sharply declines in the visible spectrum (350600 nm), highlighting the films high transparency. This selective balance between UV blocking and visible light transmittance makes SiNx:H ideal for photovoltaic appli cations, where both protection and light penetration are crucial. Addi tionally, the absorbance values are normalized by film thickness, and the bandgap of the SiNx:H film at various gas ratios (GRs) is determined using Tauc plot [19]. αhυ1/2 ( E Eg ) (1) where α is the absorption coefficient, E is the photon energy, and Eg represents the band gap energy. The absorption coefficient can be calculated as follows; α = 1 t  ln (1 T ) (2) The t indicates the thickness of the film, and T represents the Fig. 2.

Alamgeer et al. Materials Science in Semiconductor Processing 192 (2025) 109483 3 transmittance of the film. As NH3 concentration increases, SiN bonds progressively replace SiSi bonds, forming a SiN network within the film. This shift raises the N/Si atomic ratio leading to an increase in the optical band gap of SiNx:H thin films. The optical bandgap values are calculated as 2.89, 2.99, 3.01, 3.09 and 3.25eV for refractive indices of 1.95, 1.97, 2.04, 2.20 and 2.51, shown in Fig. 2(d) respectively. Furthermore, the optimized SiNx thin film with the transmittance of 96.12 % have an optical band gap of 3.01 eV, suitable for single-layer anti-reflective (SLAR) coatings as well as for transparency and UV protection in solar cell devices. The FTIR spectra for the SiNx: H thin film at different refractive index is shown in Fig. 3. The following peaks identified are SiNH (3377 cm1) and SiH (2353 cm1) stretching modes, the SiNH (1175 cm1) bending mode, the asymmetric SiN (854 cm1) stretching mode, the SiH (670 cm1) wag-rocking mode. The FTIR spectra of SiNx:H films with varying refractive indices (1.952.51) show distinct differences in the vibrational modes of Si-N, Si-H, and N-H bonds, which are closely tied to the films composition. In the Si-N and Si-N-H region (600-1200 cm1), higher refractive index films (e.g., 2.51) display stronger Si-N absorption, indicating higher silicon content, while lower refractive index films (e.g., 1.95) exhibit weaker Si-N absorption due to greater nitrogen incorporation. In the Si-H region (2350 cm1), higher refractive index films show more pronounced Si-H peaks, reflecting a higher concentration of silicon-hydrogen bonds, while lower refractive index films, richer in nitrogen, show reduced Si-H bonding. In contrast, the N-H region (3280-3480 cm1) is more prominent in nitrogen-rich films with lower refractive indices, showing increased N-H and Si-N-H bonds. These shifts reflect the varying SiH4/NH3 flow rates during deposition: higher NH3 flow increases nitrogen incorporation, reducing the refractive index by promoting N-H bonding, whereas higher SiH4 flow results in silicon-rich films with higher refractive indices. These compositional changes directly impact the optical and passivation properties of the SiNx:H films, demonstrating how flow rate adjustments influence film performance [20,21]. However, to calculate the absorbance data of SiNx:H thin film from FTIR spectra [22], we use Beers law as follows. Absorbance (A) = 2 log(T%) (3) Where A is absorbance and T represents the transmittance of the thin film. Fig. 4 indicates the hydrogen concentration calculation of Si-H and SiN-H bonds within SiNx:H thin film at different refractive index. The hydrogen content (CH) was calculated from the above-FTIR absorption spectra (Fig. 3). The density of the Si-H and SiN-H bond can be calcu lated using the following relationship [23]. NH = A [α(ω) ω ] dω (4) Equ. 4 is integrated on the Si-H integrated on the 2240-2440 cm1 and SiN-H as 3280-3480 cm1 band of the SiNx: H thin film FTIR spectra (Fig. 6) in which A is a constant (A = 1.4  1020 cm2) [24] and α(ω) is the absorption coefficient at frequency ω. SiN-H bond concentration increases initially with the refractive index, reaching a peak at a refractive index near 2.04, after which it begins to decline as shown in Fig. 4. This behaviour suggests that as the film becomes more silicon-rich, the formation of SiN-H bonds increases up to a certain point, indicating that nitrogen incorporation is optimal for hydrogen bonding at intermediate refractive indices. However, as the refractive index further increases, indicating higher silicon content, the availability of nitrogen decreases, leading to a reduction in SiN-H bond formation. The Si-H bond concentration follows a similar trend but peaks at a lower refractive index, around 1.97. This suggests that Fig. 3.

Fig. 4. Displays the calculation of hydrogen concentration in SiNx:H thin films at various refractive index. Alamgeer et al. Materials Science in Semiconductor Processing 192 (2025) 109483 4 silicon-hydrogen bonds are most prevalent in nitrogen-poor films with lower refractive indices. As the refractive index increases, representing more silicon-rich films, the concentration of Si-H bonds decreases sharply, indicating that nitrogen begins to dominate the bonding envi ronment. This behaviour underscores how adjusting the SiH4/NH3 ratio during deposition directly impacts hydrogen content and bonding en vironments, influencing the films passivation properties. As SiN-H bonds, involving nitrogen, demonstrate higher resistance to thermal degradation compared to Si-H bonds. These SiN-H bonds are essential for preserving the films structural integrity and chemical resilience. In contrast, the stability of Si-H bonds is vital for optimizing the performance of photovoltaic cells and electronic devices. A reduc tion in Si-H bonds can lead to increased carrier recombination (as refractive index of 2.04 is optimized condition for SLAR in solar cell) potentially lowering device efficiency. Meanwhile, the durability of SiN- H bonds under thermal stress can contribute to enhanced longevity and performance stability in such devices. Minority carrier density (cm3) presented in Fig. 5(a) highlights the benefits of adjusting flow rates during the deposition of SiNx:H thin films, leading to enhanced carrier lifetimes. These longer lifetimes reflect improved film quality and superior electrical properties, likely resulting from fewer defects and more precise deposition control [25]. Notably, SiNx:H films (n = 2.04) enhance photovoltaic performance by optimizing light trapping and minimizing reflection, thereby suppress ing surface recombination and improving device efficiency. Lifetime measurements for films deposited at various refractive indices, as detailed in Table 1, show that carrier lifetimes vary across refractive indices (n = 1.95, 1.97, 2.04, 2.2, and 2.51), with improved passivation and decreased recombination losses observed at certain RIs. This com parison underscores the importance of optimizing both flow rates and refractive index to enhance the passivation performance and efficiency of SiNx:H films in photovoltaic technologies. The variation of minority carrier lifetime (τ), implied open-circuit voltage (iVoc), implied fill factor (iFF) and recombination current den sity (J0) as a function of R.I for SiNx:H thin films is depicted in Fig. 5(b), measured under one-sun illumination. As R.I. increases, τ, iVoc, and iFF exhibit an upward trend indicating improved passivation and reduced carrier recombination. Higher τ indicates fewer recombination centers, reducing J0 and minimizing carrier losses before collection. At R.I. = 2.5, τ reaches a maximum of 734 μs, iVoc 722 mV and iFF as 83.885 (%) while J0 drops to 2.91  1015 fA/cm2 attributed to effective hydroge nation and defect suppression. However, at lower R.I higher J0 suggests excessive defect states, increasing recombination losses. The optimized SiNx:H layer for n-TOPCon considering SLAR applications is achieved at R.I = 2.04 with J0 = 5.39  1015 fA/cm2 maintaining an intermediate behaviour between passsivation and optical performance. 3.1. n-TOPCon solar cell result Fig. 6(a) displays the light current-voltage (LIV) characteristics of the optimized n-TOPCon solar cell under 1-sun illumination. The device featuring SiNx thin film as an anti-refection coating layer with an opti mized R.I of 2.04, achieves an open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current density (Jsc), fill factor (FF) and efficiency (η) as 692.51 mV, 40.80 mA/cm2, 80.86 % and 22.84 % respectively. The curve likely indicates a high Jsc and Voc, signalling efficient charge collection and minimal recombination losses. The External Quantum Efficiency (EQE) evaluates a solar cells ability to convert photons into electrons across various wavelengths, providing insight into the cells light absorption and charge collection efficiency. For TOPCon solar cell with SiNx layer having R.I of 2.04 the EQE is high and nearly flat across most of the spectrum (from 400 to approximately 950 nm), suggesting effective light absorption and charge carrier collection within this range, as shown in Fig. 6(b). Beyond 1000 nm, there is a sharp decline in EQE, which is expected as silicons absorption significantly diminishes in the infrared region. The consistently high EQE across a broad range of wavelengths demonstrates that the TOPCon device is well-optimized for efficient performance, contributing to its overall effectiveness. The dark I-V (DIV) curve for the n-TOPCon solar cell reveals essential character istics of its electrical behavior under non-illuminated conditions high lighting the diodes ideality and leakage properties, as mentioned in Fig. 6(c). In the low-voltage region the curve shows minimal leakage current indicating effective passivation from the tunnel oxide and doped polysilicon layers, which suppresses recombination at the contact interface. As the voltage increases, the current rises exponentially typical of high-quality diode junctions, and points to low series resis tance in the device. This exponential rise also suggests strong charge carrier selectivity and effective carrier transport through the TOPCon structure, driven by the combination of the tunnel oxide and the selec tive passivating contacts [26]. High shunt resistance of 1183911 Ω as evidenced, is due to the low leakage current further confirms minimal pathways for recombination, supporting the efficiency and stability of the cell when operating under illuminated conditions. The efficient SiNx: H layer in the n-TOPCon structure mentioned in Fig. 6(d) not only aids in reducing recombination but also maintains a high fill factor, further contributing to the overall efficiency of the device. Furthermore, the electrical properties of the fabricated n-TOPCon solar cell with varying R.I of SiNx:H layer are mentioned in Table 2 below.

Alamgeer et al. Materials Science in Semiconductor Processing 192 (2025) 109483 5 anti-reflective coating as shown in Fig. 7. The uniform bright regions indicate areas with efficient charge carrier recombination suppression, reflecting high-quality passivation. The variation in PL intensity across the surface highlights regions where the SiNx:H layer is effectively passivating surface defects, reducing electron-hole recombination and enhancing carrier lifetime. The overall intensity distribution correlates with the SiNx:H layers uniformity and the quality of its hydrogenation, as hydrogen atoms diffuse from the SiNx:H layer to neutralize dangling bonds at the silicon interface. This effective passivation is critical for improving the open-circuit voltage and overall efficiency of the n- TOPCon solar cell. Fig. 8 illustrates a Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) image alongside an Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS) analysis of the n-TOPCon solar cell, providing a detailed view of the elemental distri bution across its layered structure. This analysis is instrumental in un derstanding the composition and functionality of each layer, which is critical for optimizing cell performance. The EDS line scan displays the concentration profiles of key elements, including silver (Ag), oxygen (O), silicon (Si), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and lead (Pb), across the cells depth. The initial region, characterized by high Ag concentration, corresponds to the silver contact layer, which ensures efficient current collection. Further into the structure, a significant increase in oxygen concentration represents the glass frit layer, essential for bonding the metal contact to the silicon substrate. Following the glass frit, the SiNx:H layer shows elevated levels of silicon and nitrogen. This layer functions as an effective passivation layer, reducing surface recombination and improving charge carrier lifetime, which is further enhanced by hydrogenation. Hydrogenation of SiNx:H neutralizes dangling bonds at the silicon interface, thus Fig. 6.

Materials Science in Semiconductor Processing 192 (2025) 109483 6 significantly contributing to the cells overall passivation quality. Deeper into the structure, the polysilicon (poly-Si) layer exhibits high silicon content and acts as passivated contact, which facilitates efficient charge transport while minimizing recombination losses at the junction. The EDS layered image confirms the structural transitions observed in the line scan, providing a visual representation of the element distri bution across each layer of the n-TOPCon cell. This layered configura tion and precise elemental distribution are integral to achieving optimal electrical and passivation properties in TOPCon solar cells, which are crucial for enhancing the devices efficiency in photovoltaic applications. 4. Conclusion Herein, we successfully demonstrates that optimizing the SiNx:H layer in TOPCon solar cells significantly enhances the devices passiv ation quality and overall efficiency. By adjusting the NH3/SiH4 flow rate an optimized gas ratio of 1.3 results in a transmittance exceeding 96.12 %, with a refractive index (n) of 2.04 and a film thickness around 77.55 nm, where both passivation effectiveness and minimal light reflection were achieved. The calculated optical bandgap values are 2.89, 2.99, 3.01, 3.09 and 3.25 eV, corresponding to refractive indices of 1.95, 1.97, 2.04, 2.20 and 2.51 respectively. FTIR analysis confirmed that the hydrogen content, particularly SiN-H bonds with a hydrogen concen tration of 8.96  1022 cm3, plays a critical role in maintaining thermal stability and preserving structural integrity. The optimized SiNx:H layer exhibited improved carrier lifetime, reaching 734 μs, and an iVoc of 714 mV, leading to an efficiency increase to 22.84 %. This work underscores the importance of precise control over flow rates and hydrogen con centration to maximize the functional performance of SiNx:H in high- efficiency TOPCon cells. Furthermore, future studies may explore advanced gas compositions and deposition techniques to further tailor the SiNx:H properties, pushing the limits of TOPCon solar cell performance.
