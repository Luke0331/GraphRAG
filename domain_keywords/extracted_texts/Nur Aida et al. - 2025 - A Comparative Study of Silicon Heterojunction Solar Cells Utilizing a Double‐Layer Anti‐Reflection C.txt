Introduction Silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cells have gained considerable interest in photo- voltaic research because of their high- efﬁciency potential.[15] Nevertheless, these cells face challenges related to reduced cur- rent density (Jsc) and increased optical losses. These problems are partly attributed to the high refractive index of the materials employed, which can cause elevated reﬂec- tion and absorption losses at the cell inter- faces. Speciﬁcally, the high refractive index of layers like transparent conductive oxides (TCO) and amorphous silicon (a-Si) contribute signiﬁcantly to these optical losses.[69] Addressing these challenges involves enhancing light absorption in solar cells, which is crucial for improving their power conversion efﬁciency and overall performance. By increasing the light absorption capacity, solar cells can generate more electric- ity from the same incident sunlight, leading to higher photocur- rent and more effective energy conversion. Several strategies can enhance light absorption in solar cells, including etching techniques, using nanomaterials such as quan- tum dots, the incorporation of dielectric nanowires, and the application of textured anti-reﬂection coatings (ARC).[1015] ARC stands out for its compatibility with thin-junction solar cells, providing seamless integration and effective synergy with various light-trapping technologies.[1620] Indium tin oxide (ITO) is the predominant TCO used due to its excellent electrical resistivity and transmittance, and research has shown that ITO ﬁlms can signiﬁcantly enhance the performance of SHJ solar cells.[2125] Zahid et al. explored the use of aluminum oxide (Al2O3)/indium zinc oxide (IZO) DLARC on the front surface of rear-emitter SHJ solar cells, achieving a 0.8% increase in efﬁciency compared to a single-layer IZO ﬁlm.[26] Additionally, Lee et al. reported a 2.54% efﬁciency improvement by depositing hafnium oxide (HfO2), which enhanced current density by reducing reﬂectance through an additional ITO layer.[27] As a result, the DLARC in SHJ solar cells delivers superior performance compared to a single-layer ARC.[2832] When selecting an ITO layer for SHJ solar cells, it is crucial to consider factors such as speciﬁc wavelength compat- ibility, material properties, and thickness to ensure high trans- mittance and electrical conductivity.

DOI: 10.1002/pssa.202400651 This study aims to improve the efﬁciency of silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cells by applying a double-layer anti-reﬂection coating (DLARC) to their front side, addressing the limitations of single-layer coatings in reducing reﬂectance across a broad spectrum of wavelengths. Investigation is done on how this coating, aimed at increasing light absorption, contributes to optimizing the optical and electrical properties of SHJ cells. Additionally, the impact of different deposition quality layers is explored using atomic layer deposition, speciﬁcally HfO2/Al2O3/SnO2, on SHJ solar cells with varying thicknesses. Using the OPAL 2 simulation tool, the material thicknesses are optimized and the ﬁndings are validated through experimental results. Experimental results demonstrate that optimizing the thickness of DLARC markedly enhances efﬁciency, achieving 22.16% with a 50 nm thickness of Al2O3 and an improvement of 0.79 mA cm2. This study offers a comparative analysis of materials used in anti-reﬂection coatings to boost the efﬁciency of SHJ solar cells, thereby contributing to the advancement of high- efﬁciency photovoltaic technology.

Status Solidi A 2025, 222, 2400651 2400651 (1 of 8)  2024 Wiley-VCH GmbH In this study, we investigated the impact of adding an ITO layer in combination with various materials, including HfO2, Al2O3, and tin oxide (SnO2), with varying thicknesses. Initially, we used OPAL 2 simulations to assess the reﬂectance properties of these materials. We tested SHJ solar cells with HfO2/Al2O3/SnO2 layers. Our primary objective was to enhance light absorption and increase the Jsc. We found that an ITO layer combined with a 50 nm Al2O3 layer achieved the best perfor- mance for the front side of SHJ solar cells. Eventually, we con- structed and evaluated optimized layers consisting of 50 nm of Al2O3, 10 nm of HfO2, and 10 nm of SnO2. The results indicated that Al2O3 at 50 nm improved signiﬁcantly due to its lower refrac- tive index than HfO2 and SnO2. 2. Experimental Section 2.1. OPAL 2 Simulation We performed simulations using OPAL 2 to evaluate and opti- mize the design before conducting physical experiments. The simulation aimed to ﬁne-tune the thickness and enhance the light absorption properties of the substrate. We analyzed the reﬂected current density, the current density absorbed by the ﬁlm, and the current density absorbed by the silicon layer while also examining the reﬂectance as a function of wavelength. The materials tested in the simulation included HfO2 (cubic hafnia, Woo90), Al2O3 (atomic layer deposition (ALD) on Si, Kum09), Figure 1.

SHJ Cell Fabrication Along with ARC Coatings For the fabrication of SHJ solar cells, an n-type monocrystalline silicon wafer, produced by the Czochralski method with a thick- ness of 160 μm, 110 Ω, was utilized. The experiment employed 4  4 cm2 silicon wafers, which were cut using laser scribing. The silicon wafer underwent cleaning through the conventional RCA-1 and RCA-2 procedures, followed by an ultrasonic treat- ment. Plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) was used to deposit a 9 nm layer of hydrogenated amorphous silicon (i layer, a-Si:H(i)) on both sides of the wafer. Additionally, 9 nm thick layers of n-type (a-Si:H(n)) and p-type (a-Si:H(p)) hydrogenated amorphous silicon were deposited on the front and back sides of the wafer, respectively. An RF/DC sputtering system was utilized for depositing ITO layers, operating at 300 and 200 W power levels, with a target composition of 90% Figure 3.

The deposition occurred at a power density of 14 mW cm2, with the chamber maintainedat 200 Candapressureof100 mTorr.The ITOlayers were deposited to a thickness of 80 nm using argon gas at a ﬂow rate of 30 sccm and a chamber temperature of 180 C. The sput- tering was performed under high-vacuum conditions, starting at 105 Torr and working at 103 Torr, with a metallic mask used to achieve the desired ITO pattern. For the metallization step, silver paste was utilized and applied via a printing technique at a rela- tively low temperature of 180 C. Following simulations, HfO2/ Al2O3/SnO2 layers were selected and deposited onto the SHJ solar cells using ALD, with the material thickness controlled by adjusting the number of deposition cycles. The characteristics of the SHJ solar cells were evaluated by measuring their param- eters before and after the deposition of the HfO2/Al2O3/SnO2 layers. The design of the SHJ solar cells is illustrated in Figure 1. The study employed OPAL-2 software from PV Lighthouse for optical simulations to reﬁne the thickness and optical properties of the DLARC. The deposition process was conducted at 180 C using trimethylaluminum (TMA) and H2 supplied by EG Chem company, allowing for precise control of layer thickness. The growth rates achieved were 0.11 nm per cycle for Al2O3, 0.22 nm for SnO2, and 0.084 nm for HfO2, using the Lucida D series NP17006 ALD system. Solar cells underwent current voltage (IV) testing under air mass 1.5 Global conditions (100 mW cm2, AM 1.5 G) at 25 C to measure critical parame- ters including efﬁciency, open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current (Jsc), and ﬁll factor (FF). The study also aimed to evaluate the external quantum efﬁciency (EQE) using the QE/IPCE spec- tral response system, QEX7. 3. Results and Discussion Optimizing the thickness of DLARC is essential for improving the efﬁciency of SHJ solar cells. These coatings are designed to reduce surface reﬂection and enhance light absorption, which minimizes optical losses and improves photoelectric conversion efﬁciency. Simulation results, shown in Figure 2, reveal that a 10 nm HfO2 layer achieves an absorption of 41.99 mA cm2 and a reﬂection of 0.88 mA cm2, while a 50 nm Al2O3 layer pro- vides an absorption of 42.08 mA cm2 and a reﬂection of 0.76 mA cm2. A 10 nm SnO2 layer results in an absorption of 41.80 mA cm2 and a reﬂection of 0.95 mA cm2. Figure 3 Figure 5.

Status Solidi A 2025, 222, 2400651 2400651 (4 of 8)  2024 Wiley-VCH GmbH 18626319, 2025, 7, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pssa.202400651 by Xian Jiaotong University, Wiley Online Library on [19/06/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License illustrates the optimized thicknesses of these materials, marked with green highlights in earlier ﬁgures. Without any additional layers or just a single layer, the substrate absorbs 41.78 mA cm2 and exhibits a high reﬂection of 1.09 mA cm2 compared to the DLARC conﬁgurations. The refractive index is essential in select- ing materials for optoelectronic devices, as it inﬂuences various optical phenomena, including the local ﬁeld states within mate- rials and the electronic polarization of ions. It determines how light interacts with a substance, affecting reﬂection, refraction, and absorption. The index-matching technique reduces reﬂec- tion by gradually aligning the refractive index of the coating with that of the substrate. The refractive indices for HfO2, Al2O3, and SnO2 are 1.852.1, 1.76, and around 1.9, respectively. Simula- tion results reveal that Al2O3 provides the highest absorption and the lowest reﬂectance. By employing OPAL 2 simulations, we can effectively evaluate the reﬂection and absorption characteristics of ﬁlms and sub- strates in SHJ solar cells. Figure 46 illustrates the optimized dis- tribution of materials such as ITO, HfO2, Al2O3, and SnO2 and their respective thicknesses. The optimal performance for HfO2 includes a reﬂection rate of 2.0%, a ﬁlm absorption of 2.5%, and a substrate absorption of 42.05 mA cm2 (see Figure 4). For Al2O3, the best results are a reﬂection of 1.6%, ﬁlm absorption of 2.6%, and a substrate absorption of 42.17 mA cm2 (refer to Figure 5). SnO2 achieves optimal results with a 2.2% reﬂection, 2.8% ﬁlm absorption, and a substrate absorption of 41.84 mA cm2 (see Figure 6). The use of a DLARC can signiﬁ- cantly enhance light absorption in SHJ solar cells by reducing reﬂection over a more comprehensive wavelength range. By inte- grating materials with varying refractive indices, the DLARC improves the alignment between air and the silicon substrate, thereby decreasing reﬂection losses. Selecting the appropriate materials and thicknesses for the DLARC is essential to achieve outstanding broadband anti-reﬂective properties. The anti- reﬂective coating layers must align with the surface passivation requirements of SHJ solar cells. High efﬁciency in SHJ cells depends heavily on high-quality surface passivation, which is vital for reducing recombination losses. Therefore, the ARC materials must be chosen carefully to ensure they do not degrade the passivation quality of the underlying layers. The Jsc is a critical factor in assessing the performance of solar devices. Table 1 presents data on the thickness ranges of HfO2 and SnO2 layers, which are 3, 10, 50, and 80 nm, while Al2O3 layers have thicknesses of 10, 30, 50, and 80 nm. This table includes comprehensive details on parameters such as Jsc, Voc, FF, and efﬁciency before and after deposition. Figure 7 Figure 6.

EQE is calculated by dividing the total number of electrons emitted from the cell by the total number of incoming photons at each wavelength. Studying EQE is crucial for evaluating how anti-reﬂection coatings affect SHJ solar cell performance. Figure 8 presents EQE data for single- and double-layer conﬁg- urations using 10 nm HfO2, 50 nm Al2O3, and 10 nm SnO2. The graph reveals that Al2O3 yields the highest EQE compared to other materials. This improvement in EQE is linked to a reduc- tion in reﬂectance, which allows more photons to enter and be absorbed by the solar cell, thus increasing the current. EQE is directly related to the increase in Jsc, with Al2O3 performing best as the ﬁrst layer, followed by HfO2, SnO2, and the single layer without additional coating. These results are consistent with the JV parameter ﬁndings. 4. Conclusion In summary, our study methodically optimized the thickness var- iations of different DLARC materials, including HfO2, Al2O3, and SnO2, to improve the efﬁciency of SHJ solar cells. OPAL 2 simulations were used to assess increases in cell current den- sity, and materials were subsequently deposited via ALD accord- ing to these simulation results. This study aimed to maximize absorbance while minimizing reﬂection. Experiments were con- ducted to compare the effects of varying thicknesses of HfO2, Al2O3, and SnO2 on the front side of ITO. According to the sim- ulations and experimental results, Al2O3 demonstrated a signiﬁ- cantly greater improvement in Jsc and efﬁciency compared to HfO2 and SnO2. Speciﬁcally, employing a 50 nm layer of Al2O3 on SHJ solar cells increased Jsc from 40.07 to 40.86 mA cm2 and boosted efﬁciency from 20.56% to 22.16%. Overall, applying a DLARC to SHJ solar cells enhances current density by reducing reﬂectance.
