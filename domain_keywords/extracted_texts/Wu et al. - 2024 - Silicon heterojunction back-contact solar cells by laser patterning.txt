Patterning techniques arrange contacts on the shaded side of the silicon wafer, which offers benefits for light incidence as well. However, the patterning process complicates production and results in power loss. We employed lasers to streamline the fabrication of back-contact solar cells and enhance the power-conversion efficiency. Using this approach, we produced a silicon solar cell that exceeded 27% efficiency. Hydrogenated amorphous silicon layers were deposited onto the wafer for surface passivation and to collect light-generated carriers. A dense passivating contact, which differs from conventional technology practice, was developed. Pulsed picosecond lasers operating at different wavelengths were used to create the back-contact patterns. The approach developed is a streamlined process for producing high-performance back-contact silicon solar cells, with a total effective processing time of about one-third that of the emerging mainstream technology. To meet the terawatt demand, we developed indium-less cells at 26.5% efficiency and precious silver-free cells at 26.2% efficiency. Thus, the integration of solar solutions into buildings and transportation is poised to expand with these technological advances. Silicon solar cells usually have a single electrode on each side so that they are front- and back-contact cells. The electrode grid on the sunny side obstructs light, thus reducing energy input. Placing both terminals on the shaded side creates back-contact solar cells that are potentially more efficient and also aesthetically appealing. In 1975, Schwartz and Lammert at Purdue University introduced interdigitated-back-contact solar cells4. Swanson at Stanford University later developed a similar point-contact solar cell, achieving a record efficiency of 22.3% in 19885. SunPower, established in 1985, has since become a pioneer in commer- cializing interdigitated-back-contact technology. The heterojunction back-contact (HBC) cell structure was first developed by Lu et al. at the University of Delaware in 20076. Subsequently, companies like Sharp, Panasonic and Kaneka have improved HBC technology7,8. In 2017, Kaneka achieved a record 26.7% power-conversion efficiency (PCE) for Si solar cells with the HBC structure9. This record was later surpassed by LONGi with a 26.8% Si heterojunction (SHJ) front- and back-contact solar cell in 202210. These achievements are guiding efforts in improv- ing Si solar cell performance through combining the heterojunction technology with the back-contact structure. A big challenge in mak- ing HBC solar cells is the patterning on the back side, which usually introduces process complexity and power output losses. Although potential solutions have been explored, such as photolithography, inkjet printing, in situ shadow masking and laser patterning, they face technological or cost issues that are still inadequately addressed in mass production1116. Laser patterning is considered the most economical method for fabricating back-contact solar cells; however, the highest PCE of fully laser-processed HBCs reported so far by the Interuniversity Microelectronics Centre is only 22.5%13. Another challenge is how to decouple the use of rare indium and precious silver from the hetero- junction technology, which is crucial as we enter the terawatt era. In this work, we propose a solution to these challenges in manufacturing high-efficiency HBC solar cells for a sustainable future. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08110-8 Received: 20 March 2024 Accepted: 25 September 2024 Published online: 1 October 2024 Check for updates 1Central R&D Institute, LONGi Green Energy Technology Co.

At the device level, processes aiming to reduce the recombination current density (J0) and contact resistivity (ρc) contrib- ute to the overall PCE (Fig. 1b)17. SHJ uses thin hydrogen-containing Si layers as passivating contacts. The N-contact typically comprises intrinsic/n-type amorphous layers (i:a-Si:H/n:a-Si:H), whereas the P-contact comprises intrinsic/p-type amorphous layers (p-i:a-Si:H/ p:a-Si:H). We use i for the intrinsic amorphous silicon layer in the N-contact and p-i for the P-contact in the rest of this article, unless oth- erwise specified. The back pattern of our cells has about 70,000 mm of borders. Thus, besides the surface passivation, this unique fea- ture of back-contact cells makes it crucial to minimize the recom- bination at the borders. With these factors in mind, we identified three key process advances for achieving better than 27% PCE: dense passivating contacts, laser patterning without laser-beam-induced damage and undercut control through refining the wet chemical process (Fig. 1b). Another important factor when making back-contact solar cells is electrical shading18 (Fig. 1c). Besides reducing the bulk and surface recombination, this loss can be reduced by optimizing the contact pitch and carefully choosing the resistivity of the substrate. The 780 µm pitch (P-contact/gap/N-contact/gap) and P/N ratio of 1.4 (P-contact width over N-contact width) used in our cell processes were based on simu- lation results (Fig. 1d). Our simulations comprehensively considered their impact on the effects of shading (short-circuit current density Jsc) and on the overall carrier recombination and transport (the fill factor and the open-circuit voltage Voc). The most efficient cells were on 175-μm-thick (after texturing) 1.31.8 Ω cm silicon wafers. On a full M6 wafer (total area 274.4 cm2), the highest PCE of 26.93% was achieved with low J0 (0.8 fA cm2) and ρc (ρc-n = 25 and ρc-p = 40 mΩ cm2 for the N-contact and P-contact resistivities, respectively) values, and Jsc = 42.10 mA cm2. Masking the wafer edge, a PCE of 27.3% was attained at a designated area of 243.0 cm2 (Fig. 1e). The external quan- tum efficiency and reflection measured for this cell are shown in Fig. 1f. The lower current density of the full-area solar cell was attributed to imperfect passivation at the wafer edges, which indicates that potential improvements could be made by ameliorating the edge losses.

In previ- ous studies, we uncovered two approaches for epitaxy suppression in i:a-Si:H layer deposition to achieve enhanced passivation (Fig. 2a)19,20. A sandwiched passivation layer (i0/i1/i2) with an H-rich porous first layer (i0) deposited onto an oxygen-modified c-Si surface offered an optimal solution. However, this H-rich layer is less conductive com- pared to a denser state. We use the word dense in this work to describe layers containing less hydrogen (having a low microstructure factor R*). We developed dense passivating contacts to address both passivation and contact resistivity for N contacts. After being dipped in HF, the c-Si surface became H-covered with Si dangling bonds (Si-DBs) and strained SiSi dimers. As the main con- stituent of the silane plasma, SiH3 radicals can possibly: (A) become adsorbed on Si-DBs to form SiHSiH2, (B) become adsorbed on dimers to form SiSiH2SiH or (C) abstract H atoms from the Si surface, return- ing to the SiH4 gas phase2123. With forward reactions A and B proceed- ing, the newly formed SiH2 sites adsorbed more SiH3 energetically, impeding adatom diffusion for epitaxy through a layer-by-layer mode2426. However, when the rates of both the A and B reactions are low, what probably happens is that nanotwins form through an island growth mode and degrade surface passivation27. This can largely be prevented by elevating the temperature, courtesy of the much higher activation energy of reaction B (0.70.9 eV) compared to A (nearly zero) and C (0.02 eV)21,27. This is illustrated in Fig. 2b. The ratio of the reac- tion rates at temperatures over 190 C to that at 190 C (K*) increased rapidly with the activation energy. An elevated temperature will also accelerate the release of H, rendering the film denser and, thus, more conductive28. Besides the density of Si-DB and the epitaxy, another factor impacting the i:a-Si:H/c-Si interface passivation is the extra H supplied from overlying layers (Fig. 2c, inset). If Si-DBs and epitaxy are suppressed, the requirement of H supply from the i1 reservoir will also be alleviated. With this SiH2 promotion at elevated temperature approach, excel- lent passivation was achieved using an i0 layer deposited at 240 C. A higher effective lifetime, especially at lower to mid-injection levels, was exhibited compared to the layers deposited at lower temperatures (Fig. 2c). Notably, 240 C is a significant divergence from the common practice that favours 180210 C for heterojunctions (Fig. 2d). The excellent passivation quality in combination with the relatively low hydrogen content of 18% (Fig. 2e) indicates that Si-DBs and epitaxy at the interface were, indeed, suppressed, which confirms that the adop- tion of a denser i1 layer did not compromise the passivation, as afore- mentioned. In the results shown in Fig. 2cf, i1 was always tuned to have the same R* as i0. Tuning R* for both i0 and i1 from 0.76 to 0.40 resulted in a drastic drop in ρc from 93 to 43 mΩ cm2 (Fig. 2f and Extended Data Fig. 2). Note that these ρc values and effective lifetimes were measured after the high-intensity illuminated annealing (Extended Data Fig. 3a,b). We also found that a denser i layer was more resistant to laser fluence (Fig. 2g). More detailed properties and deposition parameters for i0, i1 and i2 can be found in Extended Data Table 1. Laser patterning Highly precise and rapid laser systems offer substantial benefits in the high-volume photovoltaic (PV) industry. A single gigawatt-scale pro- duction line can handle approximately 15,000 wafers per hour, equiva- lent to one-third of the capacity of the entire semiconductor industry29. At present, a definitive pathway for laser-patterned HBC solar cells with efficiencies beyond 26% is not available due to laser-beam-induced damage, which specifically causes Voc and fill factor loss by degrading the amorphous passivating contact or the c-Si interface30,31.

Nature | Vol 635 | 21 November 2024 | 607 reported efficiency for laser-patterned HBC is only 22.5%, significantly lower than the 26.7% efficiency achieved with photolithography. In our fabrication of HBC solar cells, three laser-patterning steps (P1, P2 and P3) were used to create the interdigitated N/P polarity by selectively removing N-contact, P-contact and indium tin oxide (ITO) layers, respectively (Extended Data Fig. 1). The top-hat-shaped laser beam was operated in two modes. Overlap mode, used in P1 and P3, completely removed a layer, whereas the single-shot mode used in P2 preserved the region between consecutive shots (Fig. 3a). The single-shot mode created partial, instead of full-area, contact between the n:a-Si:H film and the ITO layer. We found that this was necessary to maintain the passivation of the underlying N contact. For the same purpose, pulsed green (532 nm) and ultraviolet (355 nm) picosecond lasers were used in P2 and P3, respectively, to minimize heat impact32. The relations among the laser fluence, the passivation quality of i:a-Si:H/n:a-Si:H and the SiNx thickness was explored through simulation and experiments. Taking the P2 process, for example, the temperatures of both the P-contact (Fig. 3b) and the N-contact i layer (Fig. 3c) were simulated with COMSOL Multiphysics by coupling the two-temperature model with the wave optics module. The optical properties of the lay- ers required in the simulation were measured (Fig. 3d). Based on the simulation results, we determined that a threshold laser fluence of 94 mJ cm2 was required to open the P-contact (Extended Data Fig. 4a). Starting from this threshold, an increasing sequence of laser fluences was applied (Extended Data Fig. 4b), and the corresponding effective lifetimes were measured (Fig. 3c). An appropriate laser fluence should be high enough to effectively remove the P-contact and, in combination with subsequent wet chemical processes, prepare a clean interface for the contact with ITO, yet it should not be high enough to damage the N-contact passivation. In practice, the annotated point 1 in Fig. 3c was employed in P2. The simulated i-layer temperature offers more insights into the degradation mechanism of the N-contact passivation. The two annotated inflection points on the effective lifetime curve at 165 and 243 mJ cm2 laser fluences correspond to 860 and 1,060 C, respectively. In this regard, the passivation degradation in the initial stage was probably due to hydrogen debonding under heat impact. At temperatures close to 1,000 C, structural changes in the i layer can occur, leading to a continuous decline in the effective lifetime. Beyond point 2, the passivation was completely compromised. The SiNx thickness was determined from both the P2 and P3 pro- cesses. The simulated i-layer temperature in P2 increased at certain SiNx thicknesses due to interference (Fig. 3e). However, in P3 the i-layer temperature monotonically decreased with increasing SiNx thickness due to strong absorption by the SiNx layer at 355 nm. A thickness of around 140 nm was deemed to be suitable, as the temperature of the i layer could be kept below 700 C in both processes. The simulated tem- perature profiles with 140 nm SiNx during a picosecond laser pulse in P2 and P3 are illustrated to provide an intuitive understanding (Fig. 3f,g). Notably, devices fabricated with full laser patterning outperformed those using photolithography for P3 (Extended Data Fig. 4cf). This can probably be attributed to the damage to the front i:a-Si:H passiva- tion caused by the alkaline media used to remove the photoresist. We consistently observed a higher Jsc and fill factor in fully laser-processed HBC solar cells. Note that completely removing the entire photoresist without leaving a noticeable residue is challenging and potentially requires the application of chemicals suitable for the semiconductor industry but not for the PV industry. Undercut control A primary issue at the pattern borders is undercutting, which compli- cates the passivation of the c-Si surface beneath the SiNx mask formed during the wet chemical process following the P1 step. The P1 process ablates the mask i layer (a sacrificial amorphous silicon layer used for P1 patterning) in the p region to expose the SiNx film, which is then etched away by an HF solution. This is followed by a KOH etch with two 200 100 0 400 300 200 100 0 600 900 d e f g 100 1,000 100 150 200 250 80 120 160 200 240 1,500 2,000 2,500 3,000 3,500 1 2 94 112 129 147 165 184 203 212 223 232 243 255 Single-shot Overlap Single-shot Overlap Depth (nm) Temp.

An over-etch is typically performed to ensure the latter goal is achieved. During this process, the masked i:a-Si/n:a-Si in adjacent regions is etched laterally, whereas the SiNx remains largely unaffected (Extended Data Fig. 5a,b). The protruding SiNx can shield the P-contact deposition, leaving that area unpassivated. We have found that undercutting can be significantly suppressed by adding sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate (SDBS, C18H29NaO3S) to the KOH solution. By varying the concentration of the additive, we could achieve precise control of the etching rate within the range 330 nm min1. Previous studies indicated that incorporating sur- factants into the KOH solution can modify both the etch rates and the undercutting33,34. The surfactant molecules create a dense layer on specific crystal orientations and inhibit the chemical reaction between the alkaline solution and silicon atoms. In this work, we speculate that the anionic SDBS additive adsorbs more at the SiNx interface, where it has positive fixed charges, so that it effectively suppresses lateral chemical reactions, which results in minimal undercutting (Extended Data Fig. 5c,d). A clear correlation between the undercut depth and Voc was observed experimentally, complementing our understanding of the power loss in the back-contact cell process (Extended Data Fig. 5e). Terawatt-scale sustainability To achieve carbon neutrality by mid-century, annual PV production is projected to reach 3 TW by 203235. A sustainability assessment of PV technologies at the terawatt-scale, thus, has significance. We developed a tailored ESMRC model (efficiency, scalability, manufacturability, reliability and circularity) for this evaluation (Extended Data Table 2). Silicon PV technologies, such as passivated-emitter rear contact (PERC), tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon), SHJ and HBC, demonstrate cell efficiencies surpassing the 25.0% threshold. Moreover, the solar panels are reliable in field applications. These solar panels typically attain over 93% recovery yield of materials, confirming good circular- ity36. Scalability and manufacturability emerge as decisive factors for terawatt-scale sustainability concerns. A 25% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) is required to reach 3 TW annual PV production by 2030 (Fig. 4a). Critical material supply, particularly silver and indium, limits the scalability of Si PV technolo- gies, although the supply of Si is sufficient (Extended Data Table 3). Capping annual Ag consumption at 20% of total production severely restricts annual PV production to 637 GW due to the current supply of around 5,200 tonnes yr1 and a minimum Ag amount per cell of 8 mg W1 (ref. 37). Meeting the 3 TW production target by 2030 entails a virtually impossible CAGR of 36% or 16% for Ag supply (15 and 5 mg W1, respec- tively), even if the price does not surge. Hence, alternative technolo- gies for metallizing Si solar cells using abundant materials, such as copper (Cu), are in urgent need. Indium-based PV technologies, like SHJ and HBC, could sustain 3 TW annual production if each cell has an ITO layer of around 3 nm and assuming 20% consumption of the world indium production per annum. This poses a significant tech- nological challenge for heterojunctions. We achieved 26.5% efficiency with In-less HBC solar cells using a 7 nm ITO layer (Fig. 4b).

Nature | Vol 635 | 21 November 2024 | 609 conductivity needs, we applied 30 nm SnO2 onto the ultra-thin ITO layer. This positions HBC as a terawatt-scale technology that could satisfy 30% of the total PV demand (a 16% CAGR would meet the full demand). We also demonstrated 26.2% efficiency for HBC solar cells metallized by screen-printed low-temperature Cu paste (Fig. 4c). We expect that, after further advances in these technologies, In-less in combination with Cu-metallized HBC could become an important component technology for reaching the 3 TW target, thereby support- ing the transition to renewable energy for carbon neutrality. Overall, in the ESMRC evaluation, HBC outperformed PERC, TOPCon and SHJ in efficiency and scalability but was inferior in terms of manufacturability (Fig. 4d). PERC and TOPCon have scalability limitations because they rely on silver contacts. This is especially evident in TOPCon solar cells, as the extensively used laser-enhanced contact optimization process is applicable only for fired silver contacts38. The remaining manufacturability concerns, namely extra pattern- ing steps and high capital expenditure, lessen HBCs advantage. Using laser patterning enhanced HBCs performance in the ESMRC evaluation (Fig. 4e). For HBC, the effective process time, defined as the total pro- cess time excluding intermediate handling steps, was merely one-third of that for TOPCon (Fig. 4f). Additionally, this low-temperature process has a low carbon footprint. Upscaling a PV technology to large-scale manufacturing usually calls for collective efforts across the industry. We have fabricated a 634 W solar module assembled from 144 pieces of 182 mm  91 mm HBC solar cells, with a median efficiency of 26.8% for our pilot production line (Extended Data Fig. 6). We emphasize that HBC is a prominent terawatt-scale technology that could reduce the capital expenditure needed for mass production. Insights from analogous experiences in the electric vehicle manufacturing sector could enrich our understanding of HBC technology. In the near future, exploring a hybrid structure with promising theoretical efficiency could reduce the costly use of parallel-plate plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD) by one-third to two-thirds39.

The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited 2024 Article Methods Solar cell fabrication Cells were fabricated from M6 size (166  166 mm  0.25) phosphorus- doped n-type Czochralski monocrystalline Si (100) wafers with a resis- tivity of 0.810 Ω cm. The bulk lifetime for an injection of 5  1014 cm3 was over 8 ms as determined by Sinton Instruments BCT400 at the ingot level. Saw damage was removed and the wafters were polished before the cell architecture was fabricated. Cell fabrication involved 12 main steps: (1) N-contact formation: the i:a-Si:H layer is deposited in a silane (SiH4) flow in PECVD chamber 1 at 13.56 MHz and 240 C. Sub- sequently, the n:a-Si:H layer is deposited in a mixed SiH4 and PH3 flow in chamber 2 at 40.68 MHz and 240 C. (2) Mask deposition: A stack of SiNx/mask-i:a-Si layers is deposited in sequence in PECVD chamber 3 at 13.56 MHz and 190 C. (3) Laser patterning 1 (P1): A pulsed green picosecond laser (100 kHz and 532 nm) with a spot of 250 μm is used to ablate the as-deposited films at a power intensity of 876 mJ cm2 to form patterns. (4) Wet chemical cleaning 1 (WET1): The residuals in the region processed in P1 are removed using an alkali (KOH) and an acid (HF) to expose the c-Si surface for subsequent CVD processes. (5) P-contact formation: The p-i:a-Si:H layer is deposited in a silane flow in PECVD chamber 4 at 13.56 MHz and 190 C. Subsequently, the p:a-Si:H layer is deposited in a mixed SiH4 and B2H6 flow in chamber 5 at 40.68 MHz and 190 C. (6) Laser patterning 2 (P2): A pulsed green picosecond laser (100 kHz and 532 nm) with a spot size of 250 μm is used to ablate the designed N-contact regions to remove the overlying P-contact layers. (7) Wet chemical cleaning 2 (WET2): The cell is cleaned (HCl/H2O2) and dipped in HF for subsequent CVD process. (8) Front passivation: The front i:a-Si:H layer is deposited in PECVD chamber 6 at 13.56 MHz and 240 C, followed by SiNx/SiOx stack deposition in chamber 7 at 13.56 MHz and 190 C. (The front i:a-Si:H layer is the amorphous silicon layer used to passivate the front surface.) (9) Wet chemical cleaning 3 (WET3): The cell is dipped into HF to remove wrap-around SiNx/SiOx (the front film was thinned by 1015 nm in step 8). (10) TCO (transparent conductive oxide) deposition: An ITO (In2O3:SnO4) layer is deposited using direct current sputtering at 160 C. (11) Laser patterning 3 (P3): A pulsed ultraviolet picosecond laser (400 kHz and 355 nm) is used to ablate the designed gap region to remove the ITO for isolation. (12) Metallization: Silver paste is screen-printed onto the contacts and fired at 170 C in air ventilation to form electrodes. After screen-printing, the Cu paste is fired at the same temperature but in ambient N2. After fabrication, high-intensity illuminated annealing is performed under 60 kW m2 and 200 C for 90 s. An LED light matrix (wavelength 400800 nm) is used for illumination. Characterization and simulation The currentvoltage (IV) characteristics of the solar cells were meas- ured using a Sinton FCT-650 IV tester under standard test condition (AM 1.5 G, 1,000 W m2 and 25 C). The effective lifetime was obtained from a Sinton Instruments WCT-120 instrument in transient mode. The surface recombination parameter J0 was extracted using the Kane and Swanson method. The contact resistivity was measured using the Cox and Strack method. The current loss induced by electrical shading was characterized by our in-house light-beam-induced current system. Measurements were made by a HORIBA LabRAM Odyssey instrument, with a laser (532 nm, 20 µm spot size and 70 mW) as the light-beam source. The platform was moved when scanning. A precision Keithley 2450 source meter was used to measure the induced current. The thickness, refractive index (n) and extinction coefficient (k) of the single layers were acquired from a J.A. Woollam M-2000 Ellipsometer. The microstructure (R*) and hydrogen content (CH) of the intrinsic a-Si:H layers were acquired from Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy using a Nicolet IS-10 spectrometer according to the following formulae: R I I I * = + , 2,100 2,000 2,100 C N N N = + , H H H Si N A I A I =  +  , H 2,000 2,000 2,100 2,100 where A2,000 = 9.0  1019 cm2 and A2,100 = 2.2  1020 cm2 are proportion- ality constants for the hydrogen stretching mode at 2,000 cm1 and 2,100 cm1. I2,000 and I2,100 are the integrated absorption peak intensi- ties at 2,000 and 2,100 cm1, respectively. NH is the atomic density of hydrogen, and NSi = 5  1022 cm3 is the atomic density of pure silicon. The relative reaction rate coefficient K* is defined as the ratio of reac- tion rate constant k at temperatures T2 to T1. The Arrhenius equation determines that for a chemical reaction:     k c E k T = exp  , a B where c is the frequency factor, Ea the activation energy, kB the Boltz- mann constant and T the temperature. Accordingly, K* can be expressed as: K E k T T *= exp 1 1 . a B 1 2           Even without knowing the frequency factor, it is still possible to assess the relative change of the reaction rate from K*. When a film was too thin to be measured by the ellipsometer (for example, i0, i1 and i2), a much thicker version was prepared by extend- ing the deposition time, and this was measured. The thickness of the actual thin layer was then estimated by assuming it was proportional to the deposition time. The transient thermal response in each layer following laser fluence was simulated using the finite element method in COMSOL Multiphys- ics 6.1. The simulation couples the two-temperature model with the wave optics module to give a comprehensive analysis of the thermal and optical intricacies inherent in the process. The input parameters for the two-temperature model were sourced from publicly available reports. The optical inputs, specifically the absorption coefficient (α) for the wave optics modelling, were obtained from measurements of individual layers. The absorption coefficient was determined using the BeerLambert Law, where α = 2.303A/t, with A representing the absorb- ance and t denoting the thickness of the film. The layers absorbance was measured using a LAMBDA 1050 + UV/Vis/NIR spectrophotometer. The IV characteristics of the solar cells were simulated in Quokka 3. The ESMRC model From a first-principle perspective, the ESMRC model evaluates the sus- tainability of a PV technology in five dimensions: efficiency, scalability, manufacturability, reliability and circularity. Efficiency pertains to the solar cells conversion of solar energy to electricity. Scalability exam- ines critical material demands and supply dynamics for widespread deployment. Manufacturability assesses the efficiency of production processes in terms of cost and market competitiveness. Reliability gauges the consistency of the performance of a solar panel under dif- ferent conditions. Circularity evaluates the technologys alignment with circular economy principles, especially recycling and sustainable resource utilization. Supplementary Table 1 summarizes key aspects of the ESMRC factors, assessed on a scale from very low (1) to very high (5), with the scale representing scores of 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 for very low, low, medium, high and very high, respectively (Extended Data Table 2). The scalability assessment concentrates on the critical material demand and supply required to achieve 3 TW of annual PV produc- tion by 2030. Silicon solar cells commonly incorporate elements such as silicon (Si), boron (B), phosphorus (P), oxygen (O), hydrogen (H), nitrogen (N), silver (Ag), aluminium (Al), copper (Cu), indium (In) and tin (Sn). These elements are classified as earth-abundant (Si, B, P, O, H, N, Al, Cu and Sn), rare (In) and noble (Ag). The critical evaluation focuses on Si, In and Ag to determine whether their annual production and supply can meet the demands of the PV industrys expansion. The data used for the assessment were sourced from the United States Geological Survey46. Data on annual PV production capacity were obtained from the International Technology Roadmap for Photovoltaics published by the Mechanical Engineering Industry Association47. Annual PV produc- tion was estimated as the product of the PV production capacity and an optimal utilization rate of 0.85 (Extended Data Table 3).
