Keywords: energy conversion efficiency | photovoltaic efficiency | solar cell efficiency ABSTRACT Consolidated tables showing an extensive listing of the highest independently confirmed efficiencies for solar cells and modules are presented. Guidelines for inclusion of results into these tables are outlined, and new entries since January 2025 are reviewed. 1 | Introduction Since January 1993, Progress in Photovoltaics has published six monthly listings of the highest confirmed efficiencies for a range of photovoltaic cell and module technologies [13]. By provid- ing guidelines for inclusion of results into these tables, this not only provides an authoritative summary of the current state of the art but also encourages researchers to seek independent confirmation of results and to report results on a standardised basis. In Version 33 of these tables, results were updated to the new internationally accepted reference spectrum (International Electrotechnical Commission IEC 60904-3, Ed. 2, 2008). The most important criterion for inclusion of results into the tables is that they must have been independently measured by a recognised test centre listed in Versions 61 and 62 (also up- dated in 64). A distinction is made between three different eligible definitions of cell area: total area, aperture area and designated illumination area, as also defined elsewhere [2] (note that, if masking is used, masks must have a simple aperture ge- ometry, such as square, rectangular or circularmasks with multiple openings are not eligible). Active area efficiencies are not included. There are also certain minimum values of the area sought for the different device types (above 0.05 cm2 for a con- centrator cell or one-sun notable exception, 1 cm2 for a one-sun cell, 200 cm2 for a submodule and 800 cm2 for a module). Tabled results are reported for cells and modules made from different semiconductors and for sub-categories within each semiconductor grouping. From Version 36 onwards, spectral re- sponse information is included (when possible) in the form of a plot of the external quantum efficiency (EQE) versus wave- length, either as absolute values or normalised to the peak measured value. Currentvoltage (IV) curves have also been included where possible from Version 38 onwards. Three notable changes are being introduced in this issue. For large ( 150 cm2), commercially sized 1 Sun silicon cells, as well as the best outright result, the best result measured on a total area basis only will be included for the different competing commercial technologies as notable exceptions. Also, the min- imum area acceptable for other 1 Sun notable exceptions is 0.05 This is an open access article under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.

Finally, an additional table is being introduced for high bandgap cells to encourage accelerated development of possible upper cell candidates in tandem cell stacks. Highest confirmed 1 Sun cell and module results are reported in Tables 15. Any changes in the tables from those previously published [1] are set in bold type. In most cases, a literature ref- erence is provided that describes either the result reported, or a similar result (readers identifying improved references are welcome to submit to the lead author). Table 1 summarizes the best-reported measurements for 1 Sun (non-concentrator) single-junction cells and submodules. Table 2 contains what might be described as notable exceptions for 1 Sun single-junction cells and submodules in the above category. Although not conforming to the requirements to be recognized as a class record, the devices in Table 2 have notable characteristics that will be of interest to sections of the photo- voltaic community, with entries based on their significance and timeliness. To encourage discrimination, the table is limited to nominally 12 entries with the present authors having voted for their preferences for inclusion. Readers who have suggestions for notable exceptions for inclusion into this or subsequent tables are welcome to contact any of the authors with full details. Suggestions conforming to the guidelines will be included on the voting list for a future issue. Table 3 is the new table in this issue reporting highest confirmed results for cells of high bandgap ( 1.55 eV) and efficiency above 10% (see table heading and footnotes for other requirements). Table 4 (formerly Table 3) was first introduced in Version 49 of these tables and summarizes the growing number of cell and submodule results involving high efficiency, 1-Sun multiple- junction devices (even earlier, reported in Table 1). Table 5 (for- merly Table 4) shows the best results for 1-Sun modules, both single- and multiple-junctions, whereas Table 6 shows the best results for concentrator cells and concentrator modules. A small number of notable exceptions are also included in Tables 46. 2 | New Results Twenty-one new results are reported in the present version of these tables. The first new entry reported in Table 1 (1-Sun cells and submodules) is a new efficiency record of 27.8% for a large area (134-cm2) n-type silicon cell fabricated by LONGi and measured by the Institute für Solarenergieforschung (ISFH) in January 2025, with the edge region masked to minimize the impact of edge recombination. LONGi refers to the device as a Hybrid Interdigitated-Back-Contact (HIBC) cell, with hetero- junction p-type and TOPCon n-type contacts, making it a HTBC cell in our alternative designation. We retain LONGis 27.4% total area device efficiency reported in the previous version of these tables [1] since representing actual rather than potential effi- ciency as for the other masked entries in these tables. The second new result in Table 1 is an energy conversion efficiency of 14.1% reported for a 1-cm2 Cu2ZnSnSySe4-y (CZTSSe) cell fabricated by the Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences (IoP/ CAS) [11] and measured by the Chinese National Photovoltaic Industry Measurement and Testing Center (NPVM).

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License 805 for a 1-cm2 Pb-halide perovskite solar cell fabricated by Soochow University, China in conjunction with the University of New South Wales, Sydney (UNSW), and the Zhejiang Baima Lake Laboratory Co., Ltd (BaimaLake), also measured by NPVM. The striking feature regarding this result is that it is only very slightly lower than that for the best small-area (0.1-cm2) result for a perovskite cell reported as a notable exception in Table 2, in contrast to the much larger differences in the past. The final new result [16] in Table 1 is an increase to 23.9% efficiency for a small (19-cm2) perovskite minimodule involving nine cells in series fabricated by Microquanta and again measured by NPVM. Four new results are reported in Table 2 (1-Sun notable excep- tions). The first two are in the large area Si cell category where a change has been introduced in this issue of the tables. To allow a more direct comparison between the potential of the commer- cial technologies, they need to be reported on the same area basis, with total area assessed as the most sensible. This has resulted in one notable entry [1] being removed from the tables: 27.3% efficiency for an all-heterojunction interdigitated back contact (HBC) cell fabricated by LONGi and measured by the Institute für Solarenergieforschung (ISFH) in December 2023, with the edge region masked to minimise the impact of edge re- combination. Two new impressive results, also formerly eligible but no longer due to edge masking, are 26.7% for a tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) cell and 27.1% for an all-TOPCon interdigitated back contact (TBC) cell, both fabricated by Jinko Solar and measured by ISFH in February 2025 for cell desig- nated illumination areas over 310 cm2 in both cases. The first of the new entries is a small increase to 24.1% effi- ciency but a large increase in area to 441 cm2 for a commercial- size passivated emitter and rear (PERC) cell, fabricated by Trina Solar [31] and measured by ISFH. This is the largest and most powerful (10.6-W) cell yet reported in these tables. The second is 26.4% efficiency for a 335-cm2 TOPCon cell also fabricated by Jinko Solar [32] and again measured by ISFH. This displaces the previous 25.9% figure, which was actually a masked (da) efficiency, rather than the total (t) efficiency re- ported [1]. The final two entries are for cells over 1000 times smaller, echoing two of the new results in Table 1. The first is an efficiency of 15.8% for a 0.2-cm2 CZTSSe cell fabricated by IoP/CAS [11] and measured by NPVM. The second [15] is an efficiency of 27.3% for a 0.1-cm2 Pb-halide perovskite solar cell fabricated by Soochow University in conjunction with UNSW FIGURE 2 | (A) External quantum efficiency (EQE) for new thin- film cell and minimodule results reported in this issue (some curves are normalised).

For these last two results, the cell area is too small for classification as an outright record, with solar cell efficiency targets in gov- ernmental research programs generally specified in terms of a cell area of 1-cm2 or larger [9395]. Table 3 is new to this issue of the tables and shows entries for high effective bandgap (EG) cells ( 1.55 eV). Such effective bandgaps do not lead to the highest possible efficiencies but are potential candidates for upper cells in tandem cell stacks. One reason for introducing this table is to increase the exposure of results in this area and thereby increase prospects for developing top cell alternatives to perovskites, ideally more stable. Because cell external quantum efficiency (EQE) is available for every cer- tified cell measurement, a procedure with sound underpinnings [96] as described below is used to extract EG from EQE. For ideal cells, such as analysed in the classical Shockley Queisser (SQ) approach, EQE drops abruptly to zero once pho- ton energy falls below EG, as opposed to actual devices, where the fall-off is gradual. Rau et al. [96] showed actual cells could be regarded conceptually as consisting of a continuous distribution of ideal SQ cells with different EG. The appropriate distribution is determined by the EQE differential with respect to energy near the absorption edge. Reference [42] shows the spectral EQE for a range of perovskite cells and their energy differential, cor- responding to the EG distribution required to model each cells absorption edge. As the operative EG, Rau et al. [96] select the mean peak energy, obtained by energy-weighted integration between the two energies where each distribution drops to 50% of peak value. For a symmetrical differential, this will be the energy of the peak value but is shifted slightly if the distribution is skewed [42]. There are seven entries in the new table, three reported in ear- lier versions of these tables, and four new results, presented in terms of increasing EG. The first [38] and fourth [41] entries are for Cu (Ga,In)S2 cells with different Ga/In ratios, with higher EG than their Se counterparts in Tables 1 and 2, but also lower efficiency of 15%. A value of over 20% is ultimately feasible and would be ideal for use in tandem stacks. The second [39] and fifth [42] are Pb-halide perovskite solar cells, both representing record performance results at their time of measurement. The third [40] is a record pure sulfide CZTS result featured in Version 65 of these tables. Unfortunately, cell parameters were incorrectly reported in that issue [1] with FIGURE 4 | (A) External quantum efficiency (EQE) for new two- terminal double-junction cell and minimodule results reported in this issue (results are normalised).

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License 807 corrected values shown in bold type. The sixth result [43] is for a 0.5-cm2 CuGaSe2:Al fabricated and measured by the Japanese National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology [43] (AIST), with the lack of In increasing EG. The final result [44] is for a crystalline GaInP cell as often used as the top cell in GaAs-based tandem cell stacks, long featured in these tables as a notable exception. There are five new results reported in Table 4 describing results for 1-Sun, multijunction devicesall involving perovskites in tandem cell stacks. An efficiency of 34.85% is reported for a 1- cm2, two-terminal, silicon/perovskite tandem cell fabricated by LONGi Central R&D Institute [52], and measured at the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) beating out LONGis earlier 34.6% result [1]. The second is an efficiency of 33.0% for a much larger area (261-cm2), 2-terminal, silicon/per- ovskite tandem cell also fabricated by LONGi [53] and measured by NREL on an aperture area basis. In keeping with the ta- bles new emphasis on total area results for commercially-sized Si-based cells, another new result is included in this category, 28.6% for a large area (331-cm2), 2-terminal, silicon/perovskite tandem cell fabricated by Hanwha Qcells [54] and measured by the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems (FhG-ISE) on a total area basis. This equals the efficiency for an earlier result from Oxford PV reported in Version 62, but this time for a larger cell. The fourth new result in Table 4 is an efficiency of 24.6% mea- sured for a 1-cm2 perovskite/CIGS monolithic two-junction, two-terminal device, fabricated by Helmholtz Centrum Berlin (HZB) [55] and measured by FhG-ISE, 4% higher than that measured for the best CIGS cell. The final new result in this table in Table 4 is 26.2% efficiency for a 65-cm2, perovskite/ perovskite tandem cell minimodule [57] fabricated by Renshine Solar (Suzhou) Co. Ltd and Nanjing University and measured by the Japan Electrical Safety and Environment Technology Laboratories (JET). There are four new results reported in Table 5 (1-Sun modules) involving commercially sized silicon and perovskite technolo- gies. The first is a landmark efficiency of 26.0% reported for a 1.8-m2 silicon module fabricated by LONGi and measured by NREL using the HBC (HJT IBC) cell approach. The second is an efficiency of 25.4% reported for a 1.6-m2 silicon module fabri- cated by Trina Solar [64] and measured by FhG-ISE. This equals the efficiency of an earlier module fabricated by LONGi, but uses HJT cell technology, rather than the HBC approach used by LONGi. The third result is improvement to 30.6% efficiency FIGURE 6 | (A) External quantum efficiency (EQE) for the new tandem module and minimodule results reported in this issue.

The second result is improvement to 18.1% efficiency for a 0.72-m2 perovskite thin-film module [75] fabricated by UtmoLight and measured by NREL.
