As a result, lately, much attention has been paid to the composition and number of the layers used for anti-reflection coatings in order to reduce surface reflection. In the present work, single, double, triple, and quadruple anti-reflection coatings on silicon solar cells have been designed and optimized using FDTD and PC1D simulation methods. The different combinations of SiO2, SiON, Si3N4, and SiNx coatings on both planar and textured surfaces were simulated and their optical and electrical parameters were investigated. Compared to planar surfaces, the designed coatings on textured surfaces showed better optical and electrical results for almost all investigated parameters. On textured surfaces, SiO2/Si3N4/SiNx acquired the lowest weighted average reflection (0.121%), SiO2/SiNx, SiON/SiNx, SiO2/Si3N4/SiNx, and SiO2/SiON/Si3N4/SiNx the highest Jsc(38.5 mA/cm2) and finally SiO2/Si3N4/SiNx and SiO2/SiON/Si3N4/SiNx both the highest Voc(705.7 mV) and η(23%). 1. Introduction Surface reflection reduction has always been a major concern in the silicon solar cell industry An unmodified planar silicon solar cell has more than 30% reflection which leads to low short circuit currents [1,2]. Light trapping techniques such as antireflection coatings and surface texturing are the main methods to reduce the reflection [36]. Among the known methods, coatings are one of the most promising methods to achieve better results. Many coatings used on the surface of industrial solar cells consist of a single layer anti-reflection coating(SLARC) [1]. By using a SLARC on planar surfaces, reflection of under 11% and efficiency of 17.6% can be achieved [710] A SLARC at best can minimize the reflection to about zero at a single wavelength depending on the composition and thickness of the layer [1,11] To achieve a more effi cient structure, a set design of coatings is much suitable because it not only lowers the reflection in a wider spectrum range but also lowers the overall reflection. Additionally, as these coatings contain more than one layer, each layer can provide the solar cell with unique features such as surface or bulk passivation [11,12] A double layer anti-reflection coating (DLARC) can lower the reflection in a wider spectrum range via the phenomenon of destructive interference of waves, lowering the overall reflection of planar surfaces to under 8% [7,9,10,1315]. Multi-layer anti-reflection coatings can even have lower reflections in a wider range spectrum and produce better passivation qualities than SLARC and DLARC [1,7,11]. One of the notable works on multilayers would be the work of Sahouane et al. who have designed a 6-layer coating and claimed to have achieved reflection lower than 4% on planar silicon surfaces. However, due to complex equations used in designing multilayer coatings and adhesion problems, they are difficult to utilize [1]. Studies have shown that coatings used on textured surfaces would lower the reflection considerably. Furthermore, texturing sur faces and deposition methods such as the PECVD method can partially overcome adhesion issues [16]. Various materials are used in order to design antireflection coatings. SiOx, SiOxNy, and SiNx are among the most common materials used as antireflection coatings specifically deposited by the PECVD method. Each of these layers is not only important because of their refractive index (n), but also because of the specific roles they play. SiO2 is the most common layer of the SiOx family, which has proven to show great passivation properties and low absorption [15,17,18]. In the SiOxNy family, SiON is famous for passivation and can be used on both n and p-type silicon, and possess high thermal stability and transparency * Corresponding author E-mail address: kolahdouz@ut.ac.ir (M.

SiNx is usually classified into two main classes. The first group are the silicon-rich group (n 2.2 at 632.8 nm) that play a significant role in the passivation of many types of surfaces, providing bulk passivation and having compatibility with simple methods to the screen-print electrode [16,2224]. The other group which are not rich in silicon (n 2.2 at 632.8 nm), has lower refractive indexes. The most common coating of this group is Si3N4 which is the most common coating used on silicon solar cells. This coating can discourage carrier recombination and act as an oxygen barrier, dielectric, and adhesion layer [1,11,21]. Many works already have been done on SLARC and DLARC coatings with different designs and compositions on silicon solar cells [9,10,15, 21,2530]. However, few works have been done on the design and optimization of multi-layer anti-reflection coatings [7,8,31,32]. In these papers, different materials were proposed to deposit as candidates for multilayered coatings, that require several technologies which make them industrially challenging to deposit. However, we tried to simulate silicon-based anti-reflective multilayers, which could be achieved by adjusting the PECVD parameters to have an industrial scale coating. In the present work, SiO2, SiON, Si3N4, and SiNx layers have been used to optimize and design not only SLARC and DLARC, but also triple-layer anti-reflection coating (TLARC) and quadruple layer anti-reflection coating (QLARC) on silicon solar cells using FDTD and PC1D simula tion methods. The layers were designed in a manner that each top layer had a lower refractive index than lower ones. Furthermore, this investigation was done separately on both planar and textured surfaces to compare the best results of reflection, absorp tion (only for planar surfaces), Vsc, Jsc, fill factor(FF), and efficiency(η) of the coatings. Such a thorough investigation consisting of all of the possible combinations of these different layers on both planar and textured surfaces has never been done using the mentioned layers. 2. Structure design and simulation model Fig. 1(a) and (b) shows the simulation designs for uncoated planar and uncoated textured surfaces. In Fig. 1(b), The textured surfaces consist of square-based pyramids with an angle of 54.7 degrees. The length of the square at the base of the pyramids was set to be 6 µm, which is the optimum amount for achieving high optical and electrical properties. The coatings used comprised of a combination of SiO2(n = 1.46 at a wavelength of 632.8 nm), SiON (n = 1.59 at a wavelength of 632.8 nm), Si3N4(n = 1.96 at a wavelength of 632.8 nm), and SiNx (n = 2.65 at a wavelength of 632.8 nm) layers. The layers were designed in a way that each top layer would have lower n than lower layers so that there would be an ascending manner in the refractive index from airs(n = 1) to silicons (n = 3.88 at 632.8 nm). This way, more light can be captured and sent to the silicon layer [1]. Given these conditions, a total of 15 combinations could be used which are SLARC, DLARC, TLARC, and QLARC coatings for planar and textured surfaces separately. For SLARC, 4 combinations could be used which are SiO2, SiON, Si3N4, and SiNx coatings. For DLARC, 6 combinations are available which are SiO2/ SiON, SiO2/Si3N4, SiO2/SiNx, SiON/Si3N4, SiON/SiNx, and Si3N4/SiNx coatings. For TLARC, 4 different combinations are used that are SiO2/ SiON/Si3N4, SiO2/SiON/SiNx, SiO2/Si3N4/SiNx, and SiON/Si3N4/SiNx coatings. Finally, for QLARC only a single combination could be avail able which is the SiO2/SiON/Si3N4 coating. When designing a coating, it is of great importance to pay attention to the types of antireflection coatings as they are classified into two main groups which are Homogenous and Inhomogeneous antireflection coatings [33,34]. Planar surfaces are classified in the first and textured surfaces in the second group, and a different series of equations are solved to measure the reflection of each structure. In order to measure the reflection of a single layer coating on planar surfaces, the theory of reflection can be used which can be calculated as follows [31,35]: R = r2 1 + r2 2 + 2r1r2cosΔ 1 + r2 1 + r2 2 + 2r1r2cosΔ (1) r1 = n0 n n0 + n (2) r2 = n nSi n + nSi (3) Δ = 4π λ0 nd (4) Where R is the amount of reflection, n0 n nSi are the refractive index of air, the coating, and crystalline silicon respectively, d is the film thick ness, and λ0 is the wavelength of the incident light. The minimum amount of reflection can be achieved theoretically when n is calculated using the following equation: n =  n0nSi  (5) For multilayer antireflection coatings on planar surfaces, the equa tions are more complex. Transfer Matrix Method (TMM) is one of the well-known methods to calculate this reflection. According to this method, calculating the reflection of a k layer coating with the refractive index and thickness of each layer being nm and dm respectively (m=1,2, k) is done using the following equations [34]: [ B C ] = {  k m=1 [ cosδm (isinδm)/ηm iηmsinδm cosδm ] }[ 1 ηSi ] (6) Where δm is the phase thickness and ηmis the optical admittance correction of layer m. δm is calculated using the following equations (θm is the incident angle corresponding to the m layer): Fig. 1. Simulation figures of a)uncoated planar silicon solar cell b) uncaoted textured silicon solar cell. M. Valiei et al. Materials Today Communications 32 (2022) 104144 3 δm = 2πnmdmcos (θm λ ) (7) Finally, the following equations are for calculating the amount of the overall reflection (R(λ)). [3638]: Y = C B (8) R(λ) = (η0 Y η0 + Y )(η0 Y η0 + Y ) (9) Where Y is known as the equivalent admittance of the combination of layers and the substrate and η0 is the optical correction admittance of air. Although using the mentioned method can calculate the amount of reflection of planar surfaces effectively, calculating and designing the reflection of textured surfaces are more complicated and a more general method known as FDTD (finite-difference time-domain) is desirable to calculate the reflection, transmittance, and absorption. The advantage of this method is that it can calculate the mentioned parameters for both Homogenous and Inhomogeneous structures using the same equations. In this method the amounts of electric field intensity (E) and the imag inary part of permittivity (ε) are calculated to measure the amount of absorption energy per unit area (Pabs) as a function of space and fre quency using the following equation: Pabs = 05ω|E2|image (ε) (10) Afterwards, by dividing Pabs value to the energy of a photon(ћω), the number of absorbed photons per unit volume (g) is obtained: g = Pabs/ћω = 05|E2|image (ε)/ ћ (11) In this work, the thickness of the coatings was optimized in a wavelength spectrum of 3001100 nm rather than a single wavelength in order to maximize the generation rate. The FDTD parameters are shown in Table 1. In order to compare the amount of reflection and absorption over the specified wavelength range for different coatings, weighted average reflectance (WAR) and absorption (WAA) was applied which considers the AM1.5 spectrums and is calculated according to the following equations: WAR = 1100 300 ϕ(λ). R(λ).dλ 1100 300 ϕ(λ).dλ (12) WAA = 1100 300 ϕ(λ). A(λ).dλ 1100 300 ϕ(λ).dλ (13) Where ϕ(λ) is the spectrally resolved number of photons in the AM1.5 spectrums, R(λ) is the spectral reflectance and A(λ) is the spectral absorbance of the surfaces. After obtaining the optical results of each coating, the results were then imported to PC1D software to determine the electrical parameters of the structures. The measured electrical parameters were short circuit current den sity (JSC), open circuit voltage (VOC) and efficiency based on the stan dard PC1D templates available for a silicon solar cell. Most values of the parameters used in PC1D simulations were obtained from the optimum results from previous investigations, specially the amount of surface recombination of the coatings [3,7,28,30,3950] The PC1D parameters and values are represented in Table 2. 3. Results and discussion Table 3 shows the optimized thickness of each layer (d), the total thickness of all layers (td), WAR, and WAA of SLARC, DLARC, TLARC, and QLARC coatings of planar surfaces. As it can be seen for SLARC, all the coatings have a thickness of under 80 nanometers with the exception of SiO2 coating that is 173 nm thick. The reflection and absorption plots of SLARC are shown in Fig. 2(a) and Fig. 2(b) respectively. According to the reflection plot, SiON, SiNx, and Si3N4 have a single minimum but Table 1 Summary of FDTD simulation parameters.

Valiei et al. Materials Today Communications 32 (2022) 104144 4 Si3N4 is the only coating that reaches zero reflection at a certain wavelength of 632 nm. However, by paying attention to Table 3, it can be seen that Si3N4 coating has the lowest WAR of 8.470%. The absorp tion curve of the four SLARC shows that the absorption of the four coatings drastically start falling after the wavelength of 380 nm, reaching the amount of 0% absorption the further wavelength increases, with the exception of the SiON coating which reaches 6% absorption ultimately. Additionally, this coating possesses the highest WAA. On the contrary, the SiNx possesses the lowest WAA of the four coatings reaching 0.107%. Although SiO2 has low absorption of 0.115%, this layer possesses both the highest reflection (17.473%) and thickness (173 nm) among the SLARC. Overall, the SLARC has a reflection of under 4060%, WAR between 8.470% and 17.473%, absorption of under 824%, and WAA between 0.107% and 7.998% in the investi gated wavelength range for different coatings. Fig. 3(a) and (b) show the reflection and absorption plots of DLARC, respectively. Compared to the SLARC, four of the DLARC coatings reach zero or near-zero reflections but similar to the SLARC, these coatings Fig. 2. a)Reflection b)Absorption profiles of SLARC used on planar silicon surfaces. Fig. 3. a) Reflection b)Absorption profiles of DLARC used on planar silicon surfaces. Fig. 4. a) Reflection b) Absorption profiles of TLARC used on planar silicon surfaces. M. Valiei et al. Materials Today Communications 32 (2022) 104144 5 consist of the Si3N4 layer. Therefore, it can be concluded that Si3N4 plays a significant role in making the reflection reach zero at single specific wavelengths. The reflection is under 4757% in the investigated wavelengths range for different coatings.This range is quite similar to those of SLARC. On the other hand, it is seen in Table 3 that the WAR of the SiON/SiNx layer has reached 5.184%, which is lower than all other SLARC and DLARC. The overall WAR of DLARC coatings ranges between 5.184% and 11.522%. as it can be seen in Fig. 3(b) absorptions are under 8.124% for different coatings which are similar to SLARC. It is seen that SiO2/Si3N4, SiO2/SiNx, SiON/Si3N4, and Si3N4/SiNx coatings all reach zero absorption after 380 nm. According to Table 3, the SiO2/SiNx coatings have the lowest WAA of all of the DLARC reaching 0.122% but still higher than the lowest absorption of SLARC. On the contrary, SiO2/ SiNx coating is the thickest DLARC which is 236 nm. In general, the thickness of the DLARC is higher than the SLARC ranging between 90 and 236 nm. The reflection and absorption plots of TLARC are shown in Fig. 4(a) and (b), respectively. As it can be seen, the reflection of the TLARC falls under 35% except for SiO2-SiON-Si3N4 which falls under 50%. Ac cording to Table 3, the WAR of TLARC ranges between 5.554% and 9.093%. Opposite to the SLARC and DLARC, the SiON/Si3N4/SiNx coating reaches near-zero reflection at two wavelengths. Also, the SiO2/ SiON/SiNx and SiO2/Si3N4/SiNx coatings reach zero absorption after 380 nm. The SiO2/SiON/Si3N4 coating shows a decreasing trend to reaching zero absorption ultimately. In addition, according to Table 3, for the TLARC the thickness ranges between 113 and 243 nm which is thicker than DLARC and SLARC. This shows that adding additional layers comes with the drawback of having thicker layers. Furthermore, in the TLARC, the SiO2/Si3N4/SiNx has the lowest amount of WAA and WAR which are 5.554% and 1.292%, respectively. But it should be noted that if most TLARC and DLARC are compared individually, the tradeoff between thickness, absorption and reflection of TLARC are more considerable than those of DLARC. For instance, by comparing the SiO2/SiON/SiNx and SiON/SiNx, the reflection raises about 4% when the SiO2 layer is added, and there is a reduction of 8% in the absorption which helps in increasing the overall light transmission that reaches the solar cell. Moreover, the overall thickness has decreased by 10 nm, which could be desirable if lower thicknesses are a necessity in certain cases. Fig. 5(a) and (b) show the reflection and absorption plots for QLARC. As it is obvious in these figures, reflection has reached under 45% and absorption under 8.5%. According to Table 3, it is seen that WAR has reached 3.715 which is the lowest amount of reflection achieved compared to SLARC, DLARC, and TLARC on planar surfaces. Addition ally, WAA is under 1% with a thickness of 198 nm. Table 4 shows d, td, WAR of SLARC, DLARC, TLARC, and QLARC for textured surfaces. According to this table for SLARC, the thickness ranges from 100 to 370 nm. Fig. 6(a) shows the reflection curve of SLARC textured surfaces. As it can be seen, reflection falls under 18% for all of the SLARC. Compared to all the planar surfaces, this amount is the lowest range of reflection to be achieved. More impressively, this amount drops down to under 6.5% for the SiON coating. WAR of different coatings ranges between 1.263% and 4.625% with the best results obtained being for Si3N4 coating. Fig. 6(b) demonstrates the reflection of DLARC textured surfaces. It can be seen that the reflection is under 517% for different coatings. Additionally, many of these coatings have reached zero or near-zero reflection in longer wavelengths. As seen in Table 4, all of the DLARC on textured surfaces have lower WAR than other investigated coatings, ranging between 0.173% and 1.416%. Moreover, the DLARC on textured surfaces generally has higher thicknesses than SLARC on Fig. 5. a) Reflection b)Absorption profiles of QLARC used on planar silicon surfaces.

From the reflection plot, it is obvious that reflection falls under 79% for different coatings with a WAR ranging between 0.121% and 0.511% and is not much different from DLARC on textured surfaces. Aside from SiO2/SiON/Si3N4, the reflection of the other TLARC reaches approximately zero percent reflections in wavelengths longer than 500 nm. Finally, the reflection result of QLARC is plotted in Fig. 7(b). From the reflection plot, it can be concluded that the reflection has been reduced to under 4.98%, which is lower than all other coatings on textured surfaces. However, from the wavelengths longer than 380 nm, the reflection decreases to under 0.5% and reaches 0% in the range of 750900 nm. As it is seen in Table 4, the thickness of QLARC on the textured surfaces is 296 nm which is lower than all TLARC. The WAR of this layer is 0.127% which is quite low and only higher than 0.121% of the SiO2/Si3N4/SiNx layer. The device simulation results for the planar surface is illustrated in Table 5. For SLARC device parameters have a range of Jsc between 29.2 and 34.4 mA/cm2 , Voc between 695.3 and 701.5 mV, FF between 0.840 and 0.845, and η between 17.1% and 20.3%. As it can be seen from this table, for SLARC the Si3N4 has the highest Jsc(34.4 mA/cm2 (, Voc(701 mV ( and η(20.3% (. It is noteworthy that this coating also ac quired the lowest WAR among SLARC on planar surfaces. However, the SiNx has the highest FF (0.845) showing that high-quality solar cells can be made with this coating. For DLARC, device parameters have a range of Jsc between 30.9 and 34.8 mA/cm2 , Voc between 699 and 702.6 mV, FF between 0.843 and 0.848, and η between 18.3% and 20.6%. SiO2/Si3N4 of this group pos sesses the highest Jsc (34.8 mA/cm2 (and η (20.6%), SiON/Si3N4 the highest Voc(702.6 mV (. Other than having the lowest WAR (0.173%) amongst the DLARC on planar surfaces, SiON/SiNx also has the highest FF (0.848). Therefore, for each desirable outcome, different DLARC coatings have to be used. The DLARC on planar surfaces has higher device parameters than the best results of SLARC on planar surfaces. The device results of the TLARC have a range of Jsc between 33.4 and 35.6 mA/cm2 , Voc between 699 and 702.6 mV, FF between 0.843 and 0.848, and η between 18.3 and 20.6.

Interestingly, this coating also possesses the lowest WAR and WAA among other coatings on planar surfaces which were 5.554% and 1.292% respectively. However, the thickness of this layer was the highest among other TLARC on planar surfaces which shows the importance of thickness in acquiring better overall optical and electrical results. Finally, the device results for QLARC show that although this coating does not have the highest Voc (702.6 mV (and FF (0.848), it does have the highest value of Jsc (36.3 mA/cm2 (and η (21.7%) among other coatings on planar surfaces. The device results for textured surfaces are shown in Table 6. The device ranges of SLARC are Jsc between 36.6 and 38 mA/cm2, Voc be tween 693.1 and 703.5 mV, FF between 0.843 and 0.849, and η between 21.5% and 22.5%. Si3N4 has the highest η (22.5%) and Jsc (38 mA/cm2) among SLARC on textured surfaces. However, the SiNx coating has the highest Voc (703.5 mV (and FF (0.849). By comparing Tables 5 and 6, it is seen that the SLARC on textured surfaces shows better results in Jsc and η compared to all types of coatings on planar surfaces (except SiO2 on textured surfaces which has lower η than the QLARC on planar sur faces). This could be attributed to the effect of texturing in reducing the overall reflection which contributes to better device parameters. For DLARC on textured surfaces, the Jsc ranges between 37.8 and 38.5 mA/cm2, Voc between 699.8 and 704.9 mV, FF between 0.844 and 0.848, and η between 22.4% and 22.9%. SiO2/SiNx and SiON/SiNx have the highest Jsc (38.5 mA/cm2) and η (22.9%) among the DLARC on textured surfaces, which is better than the best results of the SLARC. However, it is interesting that SiON/SiNx has the highest Voc (704.9 mV (resulting in a lower FF than SiO2/SiNx. The highest FF for SiON/Si3N4 coating is 0.848. As for TLARC on textured surfaces, the Jsc ranges between 38.4 and 38.5 mA/cm2, Voc between 705.5 and 705.6 mV (which is higher than all the previous investigated coatings), FF between 0.845 and 0.848, and η between 22.9% and 23%. It is seen that some of the highest achievable results are available for these coatings. The SiO2/Si3N4/SiNx has the highest Jsc (38.5 mA/cm2), η (23%), and Voc (705.7 mV). However, the SiO2/SiON/Si3N4 possesses the highest FF (0.848). Finally, for the QLARC(SiO2/SiON/Si3N4/SiNx) on textured surface, the Jsc (38.5 mA/cm2), Voc( =705.7 mV), FF(0.847), and η(23%) are equal to those of the SiO2/Si3N4/SiNx on textured surfaces. However, it should be noted that this difference lies between an additional SiON layer which requires extra steps to deposit in real depositions. On the contrary, according to Table 4, the total thickness of the SiO2/SiON/ Si3N4/SiNx on the textured surface is 45.6 nm less than those of SiO2/ Si3N4/SiNx on a textured surface. Therefore, these tradeoffs should be considered before using an extra layer that leads to the same device Table 6 Electrical simulation results of coated textured surfaces.

Summary of SLARC, DLARC, TLARC and QLARC on planar surface designs that have the highest η. M. Valiei et al. Materials Today Communications 32 (2022) 104144 8 results. The best results of each investigated optical and electrical parameter shall be summarized in this section to help each individual choose a coating based on the optimum properties they are seeking for. For planar surfaces according to Table 3, the QLARC SiO2/SiON/Si3N4/SiNx has the lowest WAR (3.715%) and the SLARC SiNx has the lowest WAA (0.107%). For Textured surfaces according to Table 4, SiO2/Si3N4/SiNx has the lowest WAR (0.121%). By texturing, it is seen the WAR reduces by 7% for SLARC, 5% for DLARC, 5.5% for TLARC, and 3.5% for QLARC compared to planar surfaces for best-obtained results. In Table 5, it is seen that for planar surfaces, the TLARC SiO2/SiON/ Si3N4/SiNx has the highest Jsc (36.3 mA/cm2) and η (21.7%). However, the TLARC SiO2/SiON/Si3N4 and SiO2/SiON/SiNx both have the highest Voc (702.8 mV) and SiO2/Si3N4/SiNx has the highest FF (0.850). Ac cording to Table 6 which is for textured surfaces, it is obvious that the DLARC SiO2/SiNx and SiON/SiNx, TLARC SiO2/Si3N4/SiNx, and QLARC SiO2/SiON/Si3N4/SiNx all possesses the highest Jsc (38.5 mA/cm2). Among these, the TLARC SiO2/Si3N4/SiNx and QLARC SiO2/SiON/ Si3N4/SiNx both also have the highest Voc (705.7 mV) and η (23%). Interestingly that the SLARC SiNx has the highest FF (0.849). Overall, it is seen that SiO2/Si3N4/SiNx on textured surfaces has managed to have the best results other than the FF which is not quite far from the best result of SiO2/Si3N4/SiNx on planar surfaces with FF (0.85). By texturing, it is seen the η increases by 2.2% for SLARC, 2.3% for DLARC, 1.7% for TLARC, and 1.3% for QLARC compared to planar surfaces for best-obtained η results. To summarize the best η results obtained with each number of layers used, the designs which have the highest η for SLARC, DLARC, TLARC, and QLARC are shown in Fig. 8 for planar and Fig. 9 for textured surfaces. 4. Conclusion In summary, by designing and comparing the optical and electrical parameters of 30 combinations of the single, double, and multi-layer anti-reflection coatings on planar and textured surfaces, it is seen that the overall best results obtained were for coatings on textured surfaces. Among the textured group structure, the SiO2/Si3N4/SiNx coated structure presented the best outcome results with a WAR reduction of 32.6%, 13.4 mA/cm2 increase in Jsc, 11 mV increases in Voc and 8.3% increase in η compared to uncoated planar surfaces. Although the mentioned coating showed the overall best results, it should be noted that each of the coatings designed could be suitable for specific usages as each individual presents distinct optical, electrical, or financial benefits.
