Along with solar energy harvest- ing, the offered multiple functionalities of these technologies, such as aesthetic appearance, visual comfort and thermal management, open diverse integration opportunities into versatile technological applications. In this work, the first demon- stration of a novel semi-transparent solar cell based on ultrathin hydrogenated amor- phous Si/Ge multiple quantum wells (MQW) is reported. Through optoelectronic modelling, the advantages of ultrathin MQW as photoactive material to overcome the intrinsic limitations of thin (20 nm) and ultrathin (2.5 nm) single quantum well (SQW) counterparts are explained. This allows extra degree of freedom for both opti- cal design and bandgap engineering. Mainly, the multiplication of the QWs number in a periodic configuration, taking advantage of effective synergy between electronic and photonic confinements, leads to an improvement of photocurrent, while preserv- ing high voltage and fill factor and ensuring significant transparency. The MQW new concept yields a boost in power conversion efficiency up to 3.4% and a considerable average visible transmission of about 33%. A light utilization efficiency above 1.1% is achieved, which can be considered as one of the highest among inorganic semi- transparent solar cell technologies. The successful demonstration of ultrathin semi- transparent Si/Ge MQW solar cells indicates the promising integration potential of this emerging photovoltaic technology for supplying systems in relevant applications such as in buildings, vehicles and greenhouses.

Among inorganic photoactive materials, hydrogenated amorphous silicon absorbers (a-Si:H) have been widely used in different thin-film ST-PV concepts.5,7 On the one hand, thickness in the range of hundred nano- metres are required to ensure sufficient light absorption and photo- current level.5,8 However, this yields a drastic drop in the light transmission.5,7 On the other hand, ST-PV incorporating ultrathin a-Si: H layer of few nanometres deliver low photocurrent and suffer poor photovoltaic performance.911 To overcome the absorption limitations of a-Si:H photoactive material, hydrogenated amorphous germanium (a-Ge:H) nanoabsorber, with one of the highest absorption coefficients among other semicon- ductor materials, is a suitable alternative.12,13 It enables a drastic thick- ness reduction by an order of magnitude compared with a-Si:H counterpart down below 20 nm, while still ensuring strong photons absorption. The outstanding achieved photocurrent could surpass other thin-film PV technologies with even thicker photoactive material.14 Different ST-PV concepts based on ultrathin a-Ge:H technology have been demonstrated.15 These include switchable solar cell with gasochromic magnesium back electrode for window applications1618 and spectrally selective solar cell with metal/oxide multilayers cavity electrode for greenhouse applications.19 Interestingly, another specification of ultrathin a-Ge:H films is the large Bohr radius (approximately 24 nm in Ge compared with only about 5 nm in Si)20 and, hence, the susceptibility of quantum confine- ment (QC) effect in low-dimensional nanostructures like in quantum wells (QW) with thicknesses under this fundamental dimension.2123 Recently, a successful demonstration of an opaque ultrathin single quantum well (SQW) solar cell based on a-Si:H (barrier)/a-Ge:H (QW) heterostructures embedded as a subwavelength nanophotonic resonator was reported.24,25 Such concept allows a beneficial synergy between photonic and quantum confinements and a significant thickness-dependent tuning of all the photovoltaic characteristics.24,26 On the one hand, thin SQW (20 nm) with narrow bandgap (Eg  1 eV) yields high short circuit current (Jsc) but suffers from low open-circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF). On the other hand, ultra- thin SQW (2.5 nm) with wider bandgap (Eg  1.35 eV) is character- ized by an opposite trend, resulting in an enhancement of Voc and FF but a drop in Jsc.24 Considering the high absorption of thicker SQW and the low photogenerated current of ultrathin SQW, it is expected that both SQW configurations would lead to non-optimal trade-off between PCE and AVT in semi-transparent architecture. In this work, a novel concept for semi-transparent solar cells is explored by integrating ultrathin multiple quantum wells (MQW) based a-Si:H/a-Ge:H nanostructures to overcome the intrinsic limitations imposed by SQW configurations. Based on the conducted optoelec- tronic modelling, the advantages of ultrathin MQW as photoactive material in terms of photovoltaic performance and transparency, com- pared with thin SQW (20 nm) and ultrathin SQW (2.5 nm) counterparts, are explained. Experimentally, the boost in power generation and the improvement of the trade-off between efficiency and visible transmis- sion provided by MQW incorporation in ST-PV are confirmed. There- fore, the substitution of SQW by MQW nanoabsorber would be beneficial for rising the performance of different relevant ST-PV, not only static semi-transparent solar cell but also dynamically switchable1618 and spectrally selective multifunctional devices.19 Furthermore, the outcomes of our findings open new perspec- tives for further optimization through photonic management and bandgap engineering. This could be achieved by thoroughly studying the design of MQW configurations with different positions, numbers and thicknesses. Moreover, the use of wide-band gap materials as car- rier selective contacts can reduce the parasitic absorption and pro- mote the transparency of such MQW ST-PV.9,10 It is also envisioned that the implementation of quantum dot nanostructures with high degree of QC could offer more pronounced bandgap widening and stronger optical absorption.20,2729 Overall, the proposed new concept of ultrathin Si/Ge MQW semi-transparent solar cell is a promising and efficient device category with significant technological and scientific features. 2 | EXPERIMENTAL METHODS Different SQW and MQW semi-transparent solar cells were fabricated using cost-effective and industrial-compatible processes. A 1-μm-thick aluminium-doped Zinc Oxide ZnO:Al (AZO) transparent conductive oxide layer formed the front contact. The solar cell with n-i-p super- strate configuration consisted of hydrogenated amorphous silicon and germanium multilayers structured as (n-a-Si:H/i-a-Si:H/SQW or MQW/i-a-Si:H/p-a-Si:H) with thicknesses (7 nm/3 nm/SQW or MQW/3 nm/7 nm). The functional layers forming the outer n/i and i/p regions were kept similar for all solar cell devices. The intrinsic regions were composed of an alternation between i-a-Si:H (barrier)/i-a-Ge:H (QW) films. In SQW configurations, only the thickness of a-Ge:H QW nanoabsorber layer is changed. Two different i-a-Ge:H SQW thicknesses were adopted, with ultrathin LQW = 2.5 nm and thin LQW = 20 nm. For comparison purposes, i-a-Si nanoabsorber of 20 nm composed of full barrier material was also considered. In the multiple QWs region having the same total nanoabsorber thickness as the thin SQW, a periodic strat- ified medium was incorporated with six QWs of LQW = 2.5 nm each, separated by 1-nm-thick quantum barrier (QB) regions. The front con- tact opening through the glass substrate was performed by laser scribing in microSTRUCTvario system from 3DMicromac. Layer stacks of Ag (15 nm)/AZO (60 nm) were deposited as back transparent electrodes through a shadow mask to define 1  1 cm2 cell areas.

Then, all solar cell devices were annealed at 100C for 30 min. Further details on the fabrication pro- cesses can be found in Tables S1 and S2. The comparison between ultrathin MQW and SQW configurations allows to explore the practical limits in terms of the highest achievable Voc and FF for ultrathin SQW and the highest achievable Jsc for thin SQW. For the morphological characterization of a-Si/a-Ge MQW multi- layers on polished float-zone crystalline silicon (c-Si) substrate, cross- sections have been studied by (scanning) transmission electron microscopy, (S)TEM, using a Titan 80-300 G2 ETEM. TEM lamella preparation was done by standard focused ion beam procedures with a FEI Helios G4. The refractive (n) and extinction (k) indices of differ- ent functional layers were assessed using spectroscopic ellipsometry in SENTECHSE850-ST system. The optical transmission and reflection measurements of the cell devices at normal incidence were carried out using a spectrophotometer Varian 5000 with an integration sphere. External quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra were extracted by means of an in-house differential spectral response setup. Illuminated J-V electrical measurement were conducted using a WACOM dual lamp solar simulator with AM1.5G filter at standard test conditions (1000 mW/cm2, 25C). The reported experimental results of semi- transparent solar cell devices are determined according to the recom- mended guidelines in literature.30 Through optoelectronic modelling, the experimental device charac- teristics of different semi-transparent QW solar cells were analysed. The optical modelling was carried out through the implementation of the measured (n, k) coefficients data for different functional layers into a 1-D transfer matrix method using the software package Scout/CODE (by W. Theiss Hardware and Software). This method, based on wave optics, relates a specific matrix to the propagation of the electromagnetic field (light) through each film of the device. Then, a global matrix is gen- erated for the calculation of the local reflection and transmission coeffi- cients by solving the Fresnel equations at the interfaces between different layers considering the associated matrices to each layer.31 The electrical numerical simulation was established in AFORSHET software. In this program based on drift-diffusion model, the semiconductor equa- tions including Poissons, transport and continuity equations for charge carriers are solved.32 Detailed inputs of the optoelectronic numerical simulation can be found in Table S3 as well as in previous works.24,26 3 | RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS 3.1 | Structure of semi-transparent ultrathin Si/Ge MQW solar cell In this part, the functional materials system and the device architec- ture related to semi-transparent a-Ge:H QW technology are pre- sented. Figure 1A,B illustrates the device structure of semi- transparent solar cells related to thin SQW and multiple ultrathin QWs with the same total nanoabsorber thickness. For both SQW and MQW solar cell devices in Figure 1, the n-i-p region consists of deep- subwavelength lossy a-Si and a-Ge media with high and comparable refractive and extinction indices (n  k), sandwiched between partially FIGURE 1 Band alignment in barrier/QW/barrier nanostructures based on a-Si/a-Ge heterojunctions and schematic of semi-transparent ultrathin solar cells for the case of (A) thin single QW and (B) multiple ultrathin QWs. a-Ge:H quantum wells and a-Si:H quantum barriers are denoted by QW and QB, respectively. In the illustrations, QW regions are in dark grey, while QB regions are in bright grey. The path of transmitted light through the cells and the interferences inside the absorbing nanocavity are highlighted by yellow arrows.

This creates a low finesse optical nanocavity where optical interference and photonic confinement occur. In the illustration of the band alignment corresponding to the multilayer structure, narrow bandgap a-Ge:H QW is embedded between two a-Si:H QB regions. The quantum confinement effect in ultrathin QW in contrast to thin QW leads to an upward shift of the conduction band edge to higher discrete level due to the energy quan- tization, and hence, a bandgap widening is manifested.24 This imposes higher photon energy for the photogeneration process within the ultrathin QW regions and the alteration of the band offset at a-Si:H/ a-Ge:H heterojunctions. The STEM cross-section image from a similar structure with the same thin-film deposition parameters (Figure 1C) elucidates the peri- odic distribution of ultrathin MQW stratified structure composed of alternating amorphous Si-rich (QB) and Ge-rich (QW) layers. Ultrathin a-Ge:H QWs can be clearly distinguished as bright regions, whereas the a-Si:H barriers appear dark in this high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) image, which further confirms the lateral uniformity of the grown MQW structures. 3.2 | Optical modelling of semi-transparent ultrathin Si/Ge MQW solar cell Within this section, we analyse the expected absorption and the transmission behaviours in semi-transparent ultrathin Si/Ge QW solar cells by means of optical modelling.The main analytical relations gov- erning the optical behaviour semi-transparent ultrathin Si/Ge MQW solar cell are elucidated in Section S3. This includes the relationship between reflection, transmission and absorption.33,34 The semi- transparent solar cell structures are considered as asymmetric Fabry Perot nanocavities composed of absorbing a-Si:H and a-Ge:H semi- conductor multilayers (medium 2) embedded between transparent front AZO film (medium 1) and Ag/AZO semi-transparent back elec- trode (medium 3). Then, the equations governing the reflection phase shifts at both nanocavity edges in the vicinity of AZO front electrode and ultrathin Ag/AZO back (or bare air surface) as well as the round- trip propagation across the photonic resonator formed by lossy a-Si: H/a-Ge:H multilayer are established.3538 This allows the determina- tion of the resonance condition corresponding to the maximum absorption and minimum reflection, which is typically altered by the change of the refractive index of the back surface, the optical nano- cavity length and the effective refractive index of the composing media. In Section S4, the dispersion spectra of real n and imaginary k parts of the complex indices for different functional materials are presented and interpreted. These n and k data are used as inputs for the optoelectronic modelling. In addition to the optical refractive indices (n, k) of materials, the optical absorption in different functional layers across the semi- transparent device mainly depends on the amplitude of light electro- magnetic field, given by34 Absorption z, λ ð Þ ¼ 2πcε λ n z, λ ð Þk z, λ ð ÞjE z, λ ð Þj2, ð1Þ where c is the speed of light, ε is the permittivity of free space and jE z, λ ð Þj2 is the electric field amplitude as a function of depth z and wavelength λ. In Figure 2, the wavelength dependence of the normalized elec- tric field profile across the depth of different semi-transparent QW solar cells, that is, thin SQW (20 nm), ultrathin SQW (2.5 nm) and MQW (6  2.5 nm) devices, is shown. It is observed that the electric field distribution is primarily influenced by the nanoabsorber thickness and, hence, the nanocavity length.39 An increase of the nanocavity length from ultrathin SQW (2.5 nm) to thin SQW (20 nm) or MQW (6  2.5 nm) results in a regression of electric field maxima inside the nanoabsorber regions towards longer wavelengths. Also, the field intensity is influenced by the absorption in the lossy a-Si/a-Ge media as the light is gradually absorbed upon deeper propagation and multi- ple passes recirculation. Inside the thin SQW (20 nm), the field intensi- ties are low at short wavelengths below 600 nm and rise gradually at longer wavelengths. Within the ultrathin SQW (2.5 nm), the intensi- ties are rather strong over all the wavelengths range. In particular, the spectral range of the electric field with high intensities is extended within MQW (6  2.5 nm) region compared with thin SQW (20 nm) with the same nanocavity length. FIGURE 2 Electric field distributions at perpendicular incidence as a function of light wavelengths and across the depth of semi-transparent solar cells with different nanoabsorber configurations: (A) thin SQW (20 nm), (B) ultrathin SQW (2.5 nm), and (C) ultrathin MQW (6  2.5 nm). Yellow arrows indicate the direction of the incident light.

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License Moreover, the field distribution is spatially uniform across the total depth of MQW structure at each fixed wavelength. The reason of this alteration in the spectral behaviour of the electric field is mainly due to the fact that the refractive index n as a function of wavelength for thin SQW with a-Ge:H layer of 20 nm is different from the effective refractive index evolution of MQW (6  2.5 nm) structure where it is rather an average of optical indices of a-Si:H (QB) and a-Ge:H (QW) multilayers weighted by their corresponding thicknesses. This improvement in the distribution of electric field intensity implies a more effective contribution in the optical absorp- tion and hence a beneficial impact in the enhancement of the photo- current generation. Interestingly, these observations indicate possible further improvements provided that high electric field intensity favourably coincide with the QW position in the visible wavelengths range. This could be achieved by the optical design of the functional layers at the front side of the device and, particularly, by further optimizing of MQW configuration in terms of positions, numbers and thicknesses. In Figure 3, taken from the contour plot in Figure 2, we display the electric field intensities variation at selected wavelengths across the depth of semi-transparent solar cell devices for different nanoab- sorber configurations. The field maxima in different QW configurations are mostly localized within the QW regions for each individual wavelength. Regarding the transparency aspect, we focus on the field intensity passing through the semi-transparent solar cell devices beyond the outermost AZO back electrode. Short wave- lengths below 500 nm are mostly attenuated in the front side of the cell device. Then, the disparity in terms of transmitted field intensities is more pronounced for light wavelengths longer than 600 nm. It is clearly noticed that ultrathin SQW (2.5 nm) yields the highest propagating optical field across the back AZO to escape from the cor- responding semi-transparent cell. However, ultrathin MQW (6  2.5 nm) configuration leads to higher transmitted optical field than the thin SQW (20 nm) with the same total absorber thickness. This can be attributed to both the reduction of a-Ge absorbing mate- rial amount at the expense of a-Si barrier layers and the increase of ultrathin QW bandgap relative to thin SQW. Consequently, the optical modelling results of the electric field estimate an intermediate trans- parency level of semi-transparent device with MQW (6  2.5 nm), considerably higher than thin SQW (20 nm) and closer to ultrathin SQW (2.5 nm). Figure 4 presents the variations of local absorption as a function of wavelengths in semi-transparent solar cells with different QW nanoabsorber configurations. Considering the results presented in FIGURE 3 Electric field intensities variation at selected wavelengths across the depth of semi-transparent solar cell devices for different nanoabsorber configurations: (A) thin SQW (20 nm), (B) ultrathin SQW (2.5 nm) and (C) ultrathin MQW of (6  2.5 nm). The highlighted dashed line in yellow points out the interface between the outermost back-electrode surfaces and the surrounding air. The yellow arrows on the right and the on the left sides of the graphs indicate the incident light and the transmitted light, respectively.

The dashed lines point out the absorption threshold wavelength for each nanoabsorber configuration. Yellow arrows point out the direction of the incident light. 1400 MEDDEB ET AL. 1099159x, 2023, 12, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pip.3665, Wiley Online Library on [17/06/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License Figures 2 and S1, an overlapping of electric field maxima with the range of high refractive indices in the photoactive material is desired to promote and light absorption, according to Equation (1).26 Given the superior refractive indices of a-Ge QW compared with a-Si QB, higher local absorption is distinguished in all QW regions compared with the barrier zones. This points out the dominant contri- bution of the absorption in a-Ge QW in the photogeneration.26 Along the depth of solar cell devices, the regions of QW nanoab- sorber in the vicinity of the Ag back electrodes are characterized by stronger local absorption in all the QW configuration. In particular, a gradual decrease in the absorption intensity is visualized over the stratified MQW structure, when QWs get away from the back contact. One important note is that the absorption edge shifts towards shorter wavelength for both ultrathin SQW and MQW with reducing the corresponding QW thickness in contrast to thin SQW, as highlighted by the dashed white lines. This is expected to directly affect the profile of EQE spectra of the semi-transparent solar cells. The resonance condition corresponding to the maximum absorp- tion and minimum reflection is typically altered by the change of the optical nanocavity length and effective refractive index of the com- posing media. This is mainly due to change in the round-trip propaga- tion phase shift.26 Therefore, a red shift is expected when increasing the thickness of the optical nanocavity in the case of MQW (6  2.5 nm) and SQW (20 nm) compared with SQW (2.5 nm). Experimentally, further enhancement of the optical absorption efficiency can be expected in ultrathin QW with smaller exciton Bohr radius due to larger binding energy and higher optical oscillator strength. These spatial confinement conditions promote the coupling between photons and confined charge carriers.26 High parasitic absorption can be noticed within the carrier- selective contact regions, in particular on the front side, which sug- gests a favourable replacement with wide-bandgap metal oxides to enhance both the photocurrent and the transparency of such QW- based ST-PV.9,10 Another important specification of our semi- transparent QW PV technology is the angle insensitive behaviour of the absorbing resonance in the optical nanocavity. This is mainly due to the high absorption and subwavelength dimension of a-Si:H/a-Ge: H photonic resonator media, leading to a cancellation of the negligible round-trip propagation phase shift by reflection phase shifts.40,41 To this end, ultrathin MQW configuration provides effective opti- cal absorption for photogeneration process and considerable visible transmission for lighting control. This allows to optically combine the benefits and alleviate the drawbacks of both thin and ultrathin SQW configurations. 3.3 | Electronic modelling of semi-transparent ultrathin Si/Ge MQW solar cell Herein, using numerical simulation, we elucidate the impact of QC- tunable bandgap on the electronic characteristics of semi-transparent ultrathin Si/Ge QW solar cells. Figure 5 illustrate the energy band dia- grams at open-circuit condition for different QW architectures. A narrow bandgap (Eg  1 eV) is attributed to thin SQW ( 20 nm), whereas wider bandgap (Eg  1.35 eV) is assigned to both ultrathin SQW (2.5 nm) and MQW (6  2.5 nm) configurations.24 Given the direct dependence of the supplied voltage by solar cell device on the nanoabsorber bandgap, a significant rise in photovol- tage is estimated for both ultrathin SQW (2.5 nm) and MQW (6  2.5 nm) compared with thin SQW ( 20 nm). The increase of Voc for thinner QWs can be clearly seen in the large spatial splitting between the quasi-Fermi levels of electrons (EF,n) and holes (EF,p) due to the bandgap widening under QC effects.42 In the simulation, a slightly lower Voc is determined for MQW (6  2.5 nm) with respect to SQW (2.5 nm). This is most likely caused by the multiplication of the recombination sites at each QW/barrier heterointerface. Another important implication of quantum-size effects is the min- imization of the conduction band discontinuity (ΔEc) at the QW/QB heterojunction when QW thickness is reduced. Therefore, large band offset (ΔEc  0.62 eV) is resulted from SQW (20 nm), whereas small band offsets (ΔEc  0.25 eV) are acquired in both ultrathin SQW (2.5 nm) and ultrathin MQW (6  2.5 nm).25 This change in the poten- tial barrier height at QW/QB heterointerface would affect the carrier collection through the escape transport by tunnelling and thermal emission mechanisms.43 Hence, an enhancement in FF of the solar cell FIGURE 5 Energy band diagrams at open-circuit condition for each semi-transparent n-i-p solar cell with different QW configurations: (A) SQW of 20 nm, (B) SQW of 2.5 nm and (C) MQW of 6  2.5 nm. The determined Voc parameters for different QW configurations are indicated by black arrows. The conduction band offsets ΔEc at QW/QB heterointerface are highlighted by dotted yellow circles. QW layers correspond to dark grey zones, while QB regions are filled with bright grey.

Therefore, the study of the spatial profiles for electron and hole densities in the intrinsic region as a depletion zone would allow the determination of all carrier dynamics in the MQW, including transport, generation and recombination.45,46 3.4 | Experimental characteristics of semi- transparent Si/Ge MQW solar cell Considering the previously discussed outcomes of the optoelectronic modelling, we analyse the experimental performance outputs of the fabricated semi-transparent QW solar cell devices. Figure 6A presents the EQE spectra of ultrathin MQW (6  2.5 nm) compared with ultrathin SQW (2.5 nm), thin SQW ( 20 nm) and full a-Si nanoabsorber (20 nm). On the one hand, it is clearly observed that MQW (6  2.5 nm) configuration enables a notable improvement in EQE compared with ultrathin SQW (2.5 nm) over the entire spectrum range (indicated by red arrows). Based on the aforementioned optical modelling results, this is attributed to the extension of the volume of photoactive medium and the increase of the absorbance by the multiplication of the QWs number. On the other hand, the EQE of MQW (6  2.5 nm) reaches similar level as thin SQW (20 nm) in the absorption range of short wavelengths below 600 nm, implying the add-up of photocurrent contributions from all the QWs. However, a deviation at long wavelength range is imposed by the absorption edge compared with thin SQW (20 nm) due to the bandgap widening under QC effects (indicated by blue arrows). This behaviour is in accordance with the outcomes of local absorption modelling in Figure 4. The characteristic absorption resonance (maximum absorption) related to QW solar cells featuring subwavelength optical nanocavity is also shifted towards longer wavelength for MQW (6  2.5 nm) and SQW (20 nm) compared with SQW (2.5 nm). This is due to the change of the propagation phase shift controlled by the thickness and the effective refractive indices of the photonic resonator.26 In the fabri- cated ultrathin MQW material system, it is assumed that the absorption efficiency is enhanced relative to thin SQW due to the increase of light interaction with confined carriers under quantum-size effects.26 Conversely, the multiplication of QW/QB heterointerfaces inducing electronic states and strain can weaken the optical oscillator strength and, hence, the absorption efficiency.28,47 It is noteworthy that a slight deviation of the absorption threshold is noticed between ultrathin SQW (2.5 nm) and MQW (6  2.5 nm), which can be due to a relative bandgap difference. In real conditions, it is anticipated that the bandgap widening would be relatively less pronounced in MQW (6  2.5 nm) compared with SQW (2.5 nm), implying a slight shift in the absorption onset.44,48 This can be due to the impact of heterointerface states on quantum confined sys- tem28,47,49 and the change of the exciton effective mass under inter- face potentials.49,50 Also, MQW configuration with ultrathin barrier tends to form superlattice-like band structure, where a tendency of wavefunction overlapping between adjacent a-Ge QWs can result in weaker QC and lower bandgap widening.22 Furthermore, the thinnest SQW (2.5 nm) yields higher and broader EQE than a nanoabsorber composed of full a-Si (20 nm). This points out the superior absorption efficiency of a-Ge QW relative to even an order of magnitude-thicker a-Si layer. Figure 6B shows the J-V curves under illumination for different semi-transparent QW solar cells. The corresponding cell performance characteristics are summarized in Table 1. The short-circuit current values are in correlation with the EQE results, giving an intermediate photocurrent value for the MQW con- figuration (Jsc = 10.3 mA/cm2) relative to ultrathin SQW-2.5 nm (Jsc = 4.7 mA/cm2) and thin SQW-20 nm (Jsc = 15.5 mA/cm2), whereas the device with a-Si nanoabsorber-20 nm delivers a low pho- tocurrent current level, even below ultrathin SQW-2.5 nm. It is wor- thy to mention that the photocurrent delivered by semi-transparent solar cell with MQW nanoabsorber of about only 20 nm is within the range of photocurrent from ST-PV technology based on hundreds-of- nanometres-thick a-Si absorbers.7,8 A dedicated study in future on the photocurrent evolution as a function of different QW numbers would be insightful to determine the generalized design rules. This would enable to correlate the change of nanocavity length to the optical field distribution and the local absorption in each individual QW.26 Regarding the other electronic characteristics, thin SQW (20 nm) device suffers from poor Voc and FF, due to low bandgap and trans- port obstruction by the large potential barriers. Also, the extension of FIGURE 6 Experimental outputs of semi-transparent devices with MQWs (6  2.5 nm) compared with ultrathin SQW (2.5 nm), thin SQW (20 nm) and full a-Si nanoabsorber (20 nm).

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License the recombination volume in thin QW can detrimentally affect the carrier travel, the scattering dynamics and the lifetime of the charge carriers, causing electronic deficiencies.51 This can be alleviated by reducing the QW thickness in both ultrathin SQW (2.5 nm) and MQW (6  2.5 nm), owing to the bandgap widening and the minimization of the band offset at QW/barrier heterojunction. First, the implementation of ultrathin MQW (6  2.5 nm) enables to overcome the Voc drawback related to thin SQW (20 nm), leading to an enhancement of Voc from 320 to 535 mV. This is in good agree- ment with the estimated simulation results, as shown in Figure 5, whereas the MQW (6  2.5 nm) preserves a comparable Voc level to ultrathin SQW (2.5 nm) because of quantum-size effect. The slight dif- ference can be attributed to the multiplication of the recombination sites at the QW/barrier heterointerfaces in the case of MQW in con- trast to the SQW. Second, the bandgap engineering in the ultrathin MQW configu- ration facilitates the escape of the photogenerated carriers from the QWs to contribute in the photocurrent and mitigates the recombina- tion processes. This promotes the collection efficiency of charge car- riers flowing through the QW and reduces the transport hindering.45,52,53 Therefore, a significant improvement in FF is achieved for MQW (6  2.5 nm) compared with thin SQW (20 nm) counterpart, from 47% up to 61%. This confirms the enhancement of the carrier transport and the lowering of resistive losses, due to the reduction of the conduction band discontinuity ΔEC, as illustrated in Figure 5. Overall, MQW configuration allows the combination of the bene- fits from both thin and ultrathin SQW counterparts. This is attributed to the rise of the photocurrent due to the extension of the volume of photoactive medium, as well as the enhancement of both Voc and FF thanks to the band gap engineering. Importantly, the semi-transparent MQW solar cell yields a PCE = 3.4%, which is largely superior to all other configurations. Relative improvements of about 73%, 41% and 67% are achieved relative to ultrathin SQW (2.5 nm), thin SQW (20 nm) and a-Si (20 nm), respectively. It is important to mention that, according to detailed balance model, the optimum bandgap regime deviates to wider values as the visible transmission increases.54 Therefore, the bandgap widening of a-Ge:H QW from 1 to 1.35 eV by thickness reduction due to QC effects agrees with this recommended trend. Further optimization can be realized through the modulation of optical design and bandgap engineering, as well as by heterointerface post-treatments during the fabrication process. The back electrode is also an important component for the collection and transport mecha- nisms of charge carriers, which can potentially enhance FF. The change of Ag content or AZO surface termination and oxidation dur- ing the deposition processes lead to different work function and band alignment combinations.55,56 This can reduce the recombination sites at semiconductor/Ag interface under sputtering damage and can also minimize the potential barrier at Ag/ZnO interface, controlling charge transfer and electrical conductivity. Thus, we estimate that a realistic practical efficiency above 4% can be potentially achieved for such semi-transparent MQW PV. Figure 7 presents the transmission and reflection spectra for dif- ferent semi-transparent devices with and without metal/oxide (MO) transparent electrodes. The semi-transparent device with MQW (6  2.5 nm) presents higher transmission and lower reflection levels than both thin SQW (20 nm) and a-Si (20 nm), while it still reaches comparable optical performance to ultrathin SQW (2.5 nm). Counter- intuitively, higher transmission and lower reflection are obtained for all semi-transparent cells with adding back electrode compared with bare back side. The main reason for the alteration in the optical trans- mission and reflection by introducing MO electrode is the difference in refractive indices between (nAg  0) and (nair  1). As discussed in Section S3, higher difference between the refractive index of the front and the back electrodes (nfront  nback) is beneficial to maximize the optical absorption at the expense of reflection lowering.13,35 In this regard, (nAZO,front  nAg, back) is higher than (nAZO,front  nAir, back), leading to reduced reflection of the full semi-transparent cells (front AZO/n-i-p/Ag/back AZO) with MO back contact compared with (front AZO/n-i-p/air) with bare back side. It is well known that at nor- mal incidence, a maximum absorption can be linked to (nfront / nfront + nback), which gets lower in the case of air compared with MO back electrode for ST-PV with different nanoabsorber configurations. However, a clear disparity is noticed in the optical gain provided by the implementation of transparent Ag/AZO back electrodes in dif- ferent semi-transparent solar cell devices. In this context, the largest improvement is obtained for MQW (6  2.5 nm) and then for SQW (20 nm), but a slight change is observed in a-Si (20 nm) and SQW (2.5 nm) structures. It can be directly noticed that that the enhance- ment of transmission is directly related to a decrease in reflection. The minimum reflection corresponds to the absorption resonance condition owing to the recurrence of optical interferences between incident and reflected light. Since the reflection phase shift at the front remains similar for all semi-transparent device configurations, TABLE 1 Illuminated J-V outputs of semi-transparent solar cell devices with different nanoabsorbers Nanoabsorber Jsc(mA/cm2) Voc (mV) FF(%) PCE(%) AVT(%) LUE(%) a-Si (20 nm) 4.9 645 60 1.97 30 0.6 SQW (20 nm) 15.5 320 47 2.33 25 0.58 SQW (2.5 nm) 5.4 580 59 1.89 39 0.73 MQW (6  2.5 nm) 10.3 535 61 3.41 33 1.12 Abbreviations: FF, fill factor; Jsc, short-circuit current; LUE, light utilization efficiency; PCE, the photoconversion efficiency PCE ¼ JscVocFF Pin with pin: Input power; Voc, open-circuit voltage; VT, average visible transmission.

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License such resonance condition is rather controlled by the reflection phase shift at the back side and the round-trip propagation phase shift within the photonic resonator, as explained in Section S3. Therefore, for each semi-transparent solar cell device, the change of the thick- ness and refractive index of the absorbing n-i-p region alters the transmission and reflection behaviour, when changing the refractive index of the back electrode from nair to nAg. As an experimental indication of the relationship between the transmission enhancement and the reflection change in the case of MQW (6  2.5 nm), a clear shift of transmission maxima and similarly (1-reflection) minima towards shorter wavelength is noticed using metal/oxide transparent back electrode compared with bare back side. This shifting effect is more pronounced in the case of MQW (6  2.5 nm) and then for SQW (20 nm) but insignificant in a-Si (20 nm) and SQW (2.5 nm) structures. Therefore, the substantial reduction of reflection in MQW (6  2.5 nm) with metal/oxide trans- parent back electrode compared with bare back side due to the modu- lation of the optical interference and the nanocavity resonance mode is the main reason of the large enhancement of transmission in con- trast to other semi-transparent device counterparts. Among physical parameters, temperature is an important factor determining the structural and optoelectronic properties of functional semiconductor layers, considering possible hydrogen dynamics within hydrogenated amorphous materials.57,58 For our ultrathin QW solar cell technology, temperature effect can be manifested on three differ- ent levels: temperatures of PECVD deposition processes, temperature of post-deposition annealing and temperature variation during solar cell device operation. A discussion about the temperature effect on transmission and power conversion efficiency at different technologi- cal stages of semi-transparent MQW solar cell considering possible hydrogen dynamics within hydrogenated amorphous materials is addressed in Section S5. Also, it is important to consider that surface hydrogenation could induce metallization in different semiconductors leading to spatially confined electrical conduction at the semiconductor nanoscale.5963 This could potentially influence the electronic transport of charge car- riers and the optical reflection. Specific mechanisms are required hydrogen-induced metallization which are altered according to the particularity of semiconductor surfaces in terms of physical and elec- tronic structure as well as hydrogen adsorption.59,6466 However, the role of hydrogen during hydrogenated amorphous a-Si:H and a-Ge:H growth processes and upon post-deposition thermal treatment con- sists mainly in passivation of dangling bonds67,68 and in the disorder- to-order transitions inducing crystallization.57,69,70 These mechanisms provide better optoelectronic properties and film quality just below the onset of amorphous-to-nanocrystalline transition regime.57,67 Hence, there is no clear evidence of hydrogen-induced metallization neither in our a-Si:H/a-Ge:H multilayer system nor from literature.5,7,9,10,41,57 Figure 8A displays a visual image of the contrast between full semi-transparent cells (front AZO/n-i-p/Ag/back AZO) with MO back electrode compared with (front AZO/n-i-p/air) with bare back side. The areas with MO contact defined by square look more transparent and the underlying logos appear visibly clearer and bolder, compared with the remaining surface area. Based on the transmission spectra of semi-transparent cell shown in Figure 7, we determine the average visible transmission as a con- ventional figure-of-merit for the assessment of ST-PV. This parameter is defined as the integration of the transmission spectrum and AM 1.5G photon flux weighted with the photopic response of the human eye, as follows30: AVT ¼ ð T λ ð ÞP λ ð ÞAM1:5G λ ð Þdλ ð P λ ð ÞAM1:5G λ ð Þdλ , ð2Þ where λ is the wavelength, T is the transmittance through PV device, P is the photopic luminosity function for the response of the human eye and AM1.5G (λ) is photon flux under AM 1.5G light illumination FIGURE 7 Experimental transmission and (1-reflection) spectra for different semi-transparent QW solar cells with and without metal/oxide (MO) back electrode.

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License conditions. Subsequently, the interplay between efficiency and visible transparency gives rise to an additional evaluation parameter, namely, light utilization efficiency (LUE), given by the product: LUE ¼ PCEAVT: ð3Þ The AVT and LUE values for each semi-transparent QW device are reported in Table 1.On the optical visibility aspect, ultrathin MQW (6  2.5 nm) leads to higher AVT of about 33% than AVT around 25% for thin SQW (20 nm) with similar photoactive material thickness. This is consistent with the optical modelling of the transmitted optical field, shown in Figures 2 and 3. A photograph of semi-transparent device structure with ultrathin MQW (6  2.5 nm) is shown in Figure 8B. Based on the correspond- ing transmission and reflection spectra, colour rendering index (CRI) as an aesthetic evaluation parameter can be determined.30 The corre- sponding CRI of semi-transparent device with ultrathin MQW device is closer to 70%. The cell appears with a pale yellowish tint corre- sponding to coordinates (x, y) = (0.43,42) in the CIE chromaticity dia- gram. This is in accordance with the aesthetic characteristics of non- wavelength-selective thinned absorbers, based on related detailed balance model.54 Surprisingly, in spite of the multiplication of QWs, a remarkable AVT level is ensured in the case of MQW closer to ultrathin SQW (2.5 nm) counterpart with AVT up to 39%. To the best of our knowl- edge, the device with ultrathin SQW (2.5 nm) is the thinnest semi- transparent QW solar cell reported in literature so far. Moreover, both ultrathin SQW (2.5 nm) and MQW (6  2.5 nm) are more advanta- geous in terms of achieving high visible transmission than full a-Si nanoabsorber (20 nm). It is worthy to mention that MQW concept provides an extra degree of freedom in the optical management that could allow to tune the transparency and to improve the photocurrent of semi- transparent solar cell. This could be achieved via the adjustment of design of MQW configurations with different positions, numbers and thicknesses. In addition, the thickness adjustment of Ag/AZO bilayer allows a considerable tuning of the AVT and CRI attributes. This can enable a good control of the aesthetic and the lightning of semi- transparent QW PV technology. Interestingly, MQW (6  2.5 nm) yields a striking boost in LUE exceeding 1.1%, compared with thin (LUE = 0.58%) and ultrathin (LUE = 0.73%) SQW counterparts. This LUE level can be considered as higher than most of other semi-transparent inorganic technologies in the state of the art and close the record among inorganic counter- parts (1.3%).7 To this end, the integration of MQW as nanoabsorber in novel semi-transparent ultrathin Si/Ge solar cell allows to overcome the physical limitations of SQW counterparts, that is, low absorbance for ultrathin SQW and inappropriate electronic structure for the thin SQW. The bandgap engineering and optical design features enable an optimum trade-off between efficiency and transparency, by enhanc- ing the power generation performance while preserving a consider- ably high visible transmission level. 4 | CONCLUSIONS In this work, we report the prime proof of concept for a novel semi-transparent solar cell based on multiple QWs as ultrathin nanoabsorber. The here presented semi-transparent device concept employing amorphous Si/Ge quantum confined nanostructures inte- grated in a subwavelength nanophotonic resonator is unique of its kind. This MQW architecture enables the improvement of PV per- formance owing to extra degree of freedom in both photonic man- agement and bandgap engineering, rather than just thinning approach.

Based on optical modelling of the electric field and the local absorption distributions, the improvement of photocurrent and the maintaining of high transmission in MQW (6  2.5 nm) with respect to ultrathin SQW (2.5 nm) are explained. The impact of the threshold absorption difference between MQW (6  2.5 nm) and thin SQW (20 nm) on the EQE deviation and the photocurrent level is analysed. According to electrical simulation, the bandgap widening and the minimization of QW/QB conduction band offset under QC effects are determined as the main reasons for higher Voc and FF in ultrathin SQW (2.5 nm) and MQW (6  2.5 nm) compared with thin SQW (20 nm). Therefore, such emerging semi-transparent MQW PV tech- nology takes advantage of an effective synergy between quantum and photonic confinements to boost both the power generation and visible transmission levels, achieving an optimum trade-off between efficiency and transparency. In addition, the design rules for further improvement through spectral and bandgap engineering are indicated. Overall, the main output of this work is the experimental demon- stration of the effectiveness of amorphous Si/Ge MQW concept in boosting the power conversion efficiency of about 3.4%, while pre- serving a considerable average visible transmission level around 33%. A corresponding light utilization efficiency above 1.1% is achieved, which can be considered as one of the highest among inorganic semi- transparent solar cell technologies. The current demonstration of ultrathin semi-transparent MQW PV technology points out the prom- ising potential for integration in relevant applications such as in build- ings, vehicles and greenhouses.
