Article https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-55681-1 Improved silicon solar cells by tuning angular response to solar trajectory Martin A. Green & Zibo Zhou Silicon solar cell costs are reducing dramatically with these cells now providing the majority of new electricity generation capacity worldwide. Cost reduction has been via economies of scale and steadily increasing sunlight energy con- version efﬁciency. The best experimental cells at 27.4% efﬁciency approach the 29.4% ﬁgure almost universally regarded as the limit on silicon cell perfor- mance. Here we show that assumptions in deducing this limit are too restric- tive, since failing to incorporate sunlight directionality. Furthermore, we show how this directionality and the cells angular response can be quantiﬁed compatibly, using projections of angular dependencies of both onto the solar module plane. Even simple schemes for exploiting directionality, including installing solar modules facing the equator at near-latitude tilt, increase the- oretical limiting efﬁciency above 29.4%. Highest gains are for cells designed for sunlight tracking systems, including common 1-axis trackers, with such cells having theoretical efﬁciency limits  30%. In this work, we provide a strategy for ongoing improvements in commercial cell efﬁciency over this decade, additionally lowering cost via reduced cell thickness. Recent solar cost reductions1 have been accompanied by commer- cialisation of increasingly sophisticated silicon cell technology tar- geting increased energy conversion efﬁciency. Although tandem stacks of multiple bandgap cells offer even higher efﬁciencies, com- mercialising the leading perovskite-silicon tandem candidate2 con- tinues to be delayed by perovskite stability challenges. Consequently, further improving silicon cells to extract their full efﬁciency potential while reducing costs, such as by using thinner cells, will remain critical over this decade. Following the 1954 announcement of the ﬁrst 4% efﬁcient silicon cells3, efﬁciency limit calculations soon followed4,5, with 21.7% and 20.3% deduced in 1955 and 1956. In a landmark 1961 study6, Shockley and Queisser (SQ) derived much higher fundamental limits, deter- mined by cell radiative properties. Although deducing only 26% efﬁ- ciency for silicon under 6000 K blackbody illumination, their approach gives a much higher 33.3% efﬁciency under the now-standard Air Mass 1.5 solar reference spectrum. Since silicons indirect bandgap makes silicon cells radiatively inefﬁcient7, relevance of the SQ approach to silicon was largely discounted. In 1984, Green8 showed that intrinsic Auger recombination, whereby photogenerated carriers give their energy to neighbours unable to use it effectively, limits sili- con cell performance similarly to radiative processes in the SQ approach. He deduced an efﬁciency limit of 2930% for cells 100 μm thick, but 30% for cells 100 μm thick. In a slightly later paper, Tiedje et al.9 extended Greens analytical approach using computer modelling, placing restrictions on sunlight absorption using Yablonovitchs then recently published light- trapping theory10. This showed sunlight randomisation increases the average pathlength of weakly-absorbed light in the cell, the Z factor, by 4 n2 where n is the cells refractive index, a massive 50 times boost for silicon. While conclusions were also that limits were 2930% for cells 100 μm thick9, this work predicted peak efﬁciency around 100 μm thickness, decreasing for thicknesses 100 μm. Subsequent reﬁne- ments reinforce these conclusions1114, with the presently accepted 29.4% limiting efﬁciency ﬁrst reported11 in 2013, reafﬁrmed12 in 2022. This difference from Greens earlier conclusions, arising from different absorption assumptions (Fig. 1a, b), becomes important as commercial cells approach 100-μm thickness15. Green8 assumed all incoming light was absorbed, only strictly possible if collimated and hence having zero entropy, consistent with calculating upper limits.

Although previously overlooked1114, this produces a lower rather than upper bound on limiting efﬁciency. Figure 1c compares the two cases, showing the latest calculation using Yablonovitchs approach giving the accepted 29.4% efﬁciency limit12, as well as a zero entropy calcu- lation using identical parameters (Methods). Since most practical solar systems exploit sunlight directionality, the actual efﬁciency limit must lie somewhere between the two extremes of Fig. 1c, depending upon the degree of exploitation. The inescapable conclusion is that the cell efﬁciency bound in any actual system is higher than the presently accepted 29.4% limit. In this work, we show how directionality and the cells angular response can be quantiﬁed compatibly, with practical implications for how cell design must evolve as cell performance pushes closer towards its limits, particularly as cell thickness reduces below 100 μm. Results Quantifying Directionality Given daily and seasonal variations and scattering over the terrestrial hemisphere, quantifying sunlight directionality would appear difﬁcult. However, the work of Ivanov and Gueymard16 alerted us to this pos- sibility. These authors ﬁrst project accumulated annual radiance onto the terrestrial hemisphere (Fig. 2a) followed by a parallel ﬁsheye projection onto a plane of interest (Fig. 2b). This converts radiance into an irradiance contribution from the same direction on this plane. Figure 2a shows cumulative radiance for Soﬁa, Bulgaria projected onto the terrestrial hemisphere16, with Fig. 2c showing the resulting pro- jection onto a unit circle parallel to the horizontal. However, Fig. 2d shows a more interesting projection onto a unit circle parallel to a south-facing plane, tilted at the latitude angle from horizontal, the well-known rule-of-thumb for maximising annual ﬁxed-tilt solar sys- tem output17,18. The simplicity of Fig. 2d, with direct sunlight conﬁned to a central band of incident angles, and its worldwide universality alerted us to prospects for quantifying sunlight directionality this way, reinforced by our earlier workexploring approaches for exceeding Yablonovitchs 4 n2 enhancement limit using geometrical (non-randomising) schemes19,20. Campbell and Green19 ﬁrst showed the Z limit increased to 4 n2/sin2θ when cells only needed to respond to light within an angle θ of the cell normal, such as in sunlight focussing systems. They then showed20 that, for some schemes, Z could exceed 4n2 at some angles at the expense of performance at other angles. This trade-off was subsequently quantiﬁed by Yu and Fan21, gen- eralising Yablonovitchs result10 to: Z π=2 0 dθ Z 2π 0 Z θ, ϕ ð Þ cos θ ð Þ sin θ ð Þdϕ 4πn2 ð1Þ where θ and ϕ are altitudinal and azimuthal angles. Equation (1) has a simple geometric interpretation. If Z θ, ϕ ð Þ is plotted as for radiance in Fig. 2a, referenced to the cell normal, and the same ﬁsh-eye projection used, the average value over the unit circle must be 4 n2. (In Methods, we extend Eq. 1 to bifacial cells responding to both front and rear light, increasing limits on the dθ integral0π/2 becoming 0πeffectively halving average Z. However, equal sharing of Z between front and rear is not mandated, potentially important for cell design). Fixed tilt systems and sunlight directionality Cell design can be optimised for speciﬁc applications by selecting light-trapping schemes angularly matched to the input sunlight dis- tribution. As an example, Fig. 2e shows idealised light-trapping pro- jections conforming to Eq. 1 for south-facing modules (northern hemisphere) both at latitude and arbitrary tilt. For latitude tilt, stron- gest light-trapping is required for the central band representing directions of both direct and strongest diffuse sunlight. If we incor- porate a 2.9o half-angle region encircling the solar disc accounting for both circumsolar radiation and alignment accuracy (as for the AM1.5 directreference spectrum22), this band occupies 54.7% of the projected area. Regions outside this band are less criticalassociated irradiance is much weaker and blue-rich as shown in Fig. 3, giving proportionately smaller infrared light-trapping gain. Consequently, if modest n2 boost is assigned to these regions, 6.5 n2 is available from the all-important central band while satisfying Eq. (1). This increases limiting efﬁciency for all cell thicknesses, peaking at 29.7% for cells 60 μm thick, in the blue zone of Fig. 1c. With cells 100 μm thick already contemplated to reduce wafer costs15, appreciably thinner cells are feasible while improving efﬁciency. The rule-of-thumb tilt does not necessarily maximise annual energy production17,18, generally peaking at lower tilts pointing mod- ules more towards the summer solstice (Fig. 2a, d). This causes the central band projection to droop, as for a horizontal module (Fig. 2c).

The 29.4% value previously regarded as a limit11,12 is seen to be a lower bound, possible to exceed if cells exploit sunlight directionality. Article https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-55681-1 Nature Communications| (2025) 16:251 2 All possible tilts are conservatively accommodated by assigning the lower region of Fig. 2e the same Z as the central band, reducing it to 4.9 n2 over the extended region. This gives limiting efﬁciency of 29.529.6% (vertical deviations accommodated by 180o rotation of cells or modules). Another growing stationary mounting23 is vertically installed bifacial modules facing due east and west. Again, direct sunlight pro- jections lie in a band, rotated from horizontal by the complement of the latitude16. 2-axis trackers Although 2-axis trackers represent a negligible fraction (1%) of solar systems installed24 in 2024, these provide maximum potential for boosting cell efﬁciency. Ideally, 2-axis trackers align the module nor- mal directly with the sun25, projecting it to the centre of the unit circle (Fig. 4a), occupying only 1/400th of its area even with the 2.9o cir- cumsolar region included. High Z consequently can be assigned to the central region without signiﬁcantly reducing Z for non-perpendicular light, sufﬁciently high for cells to approach the zero entropy efﬁciency limit of Fig. 1c. Assigning 3 n2 to peripheral regions allows 390 n2 to be assigned to the central region, giving cell limits over 31% for cells 100 μm thick. The challenge is to ﬁnd practical schemes sufﬁciently resonant to attain such high Z experimentally. The minor Z reduction for non-normal incidence means cells can perform with limiting efﬁciency above 29% for non-normal direct sunlight, such as the module receives when back- tracking (to avoid shading adjacent trackers at low sun angles). 1-Axis Trackers 1-axis trackers are expected24 to account for 60% of large solar power plant installed in 2024 (remainder mostly stationary, ﬁxed-tilt sys- tems). Ideally, these ensure the module normal lies in the plane of the tracker axis and the suns direction25. The vast majority have NS-axis orientation, being particularly effective26 at latitudes 40o. The pro- jected sun-path for less common EW-axis trackers is simpler (Fig. 4b). The sun merely follows a horizontal EW path (not reaching EW boundaries in winter), occupying 1/15th of the total projected area, again allowing high Z across this band without signiﬁcantly sacriﬁcing Z for incidence outside it. Assigning 3n2 for the latter allows values  19n2 in the band, giving limiting efﬁciency 30% for appro- priately designed cells. The path for more common NS-axis orientation is latitude dependent as shown for 40o latitude (Fig. 4c), generally the highest appropriate for such NS-axis trackers26. The path is bounded by sun positions in the morning and evening of the summer solstice and at winter solstice noon, equal to sin(δ)/cos(ϕ) and sin(δ + ϕ) times the radius along the axis, respectively. This limits the band area to 1/23rd of the unit circle (latitudes 40o), allowing even better light-trapping trade-offs than for EW-axis trackers. The case of ideal backtracking for a NS-axis tracker is shown in Fig. 4d. Trackers start close to horizontal in the morning to prevent shading those more westerly. As solar elevation increases, trackers tilt towards the vertical, working towards their optimal orientation (sun in plane of axis and module normal). Thisisreached when the tracker is at maximum tilt (normally 60o from horizontal), if system is fully Fig. 2 | Quantifying sunlight directionality and cell angular response. a Accumulated radiance (typical meteorological year) projected onto the terrestrial hemisphere for Soﬁa (latitude 42.7oN), with different scales for direct and diffuse radiation (in kWh/m2/sr)16. b Orthographic ﬁsheye projection from unit hemisphere to unit circle, with the circle plane orientated to match solar module orientation. c Projection of Fig. 2a onto a horizontal unit circle16. d Projection of Fig. 2a onto a unit circle tilted at the latitude angle facing south16 (lower green region represents ground- reﬂection). e If the pathlength enhancement factor as a function of altitudinal and azimuthal co-ordinates referenced to the cell normal, Z θ, ϕ ð Þ, is projected onto the unit hemisphere, then onto the unit circle corresponding to the cell plane, the average value over the circle must be 4 n2. Two conforming light-trapping designs shown, one for latitude tilt giving 6.5 n2 enhancement over the central band (where both direct and diffuse light are strongest), with a lower value of n2 over segments receiving only diffuse light. The second conservatively accommodates arbitrary tilt (including ver- tical or horizontal orientation), with the central enhancement extended into either lower or upper zones.

Rather than 2-region partitioning (Fig. 2e), one could imagine 3-region partitioning, for example, assigning 4 n2 for backtracking angles, reduced Z in diffuse light areas and correspondingly increased Z in the now reduced areas where optimal tracking occurs. Light-trapping structures Several light-trapping approaches suited for mainstream silicon cells have been previously proposed and analysed1921,2731, although seldom in the context of linking to the likely angular sunlight distribution in any given application as now possible. The following sections discuss a selection of these, including experimental aspects where available. Angular absorption cutoff The ﬁrst of such light-trapping approaches was suggested some time ago19 but takes advantage of the shift of bandpass antireﬂection coating cutoff to shorter wavelength for obliquely incident light, with the basic concept shown in Fig. 5a. While the cell illustrated accepts near-perpendicular light at all desired wavelengths, obliquely incident light is reﬂected at infrared wavelengths near the coating cutoff. A concrete example is shown in Fig. 5b. Exploring the angular performance of a 51-layer AR coating shown in Fig. 5b, well-behaved performance prevails up to 50o from normal. While 1100 nm wavelength light will be strongly coupled in if incident within 20o of the normal, it will be inhibited from being coupled out if scattered into other angles. Above 60o, visible wavelength reﬂection remains lower than from uncoated glass, but the increasing cut-off shift nonetheless disadvantageously reduces current generation to below that of uncoated glass. This effect already occurs to a minor extent with present glass antireﬂection coatings but may increase in importance as these become more sophisticated. Cross-groove texture Figure 6a shows cross-grooves32, early demonstrated20 to give Z  4n2. Grooves can be formed using similar etching to present commercial random pyramidal texturing approaches, although complicated by requiring groove location deﬁnition. Groove sidewall angles can be controlled within the 4954o range (intersecting {111} planes), with this angle and slat height to cell thickness ratio important in deter- mining performance (Fig. 1, Supplementary Information). Figure 6b shows good general-purpose response from a 49o slat design suitable for ﬁxed-tilt and 1- and 2-axis trackers. For near- perpendicular light, limiting efﬁciency is 30% for cells 100 μm thick, peaking at 30.1% for cells only 4050 μm thick (Fig. 6c), interesting for 2-axis trackers. The central band in Fig. 6b with average Z  4 n2 indi- cates improved performance for modules mounted near-latitude tilt, with bright yellow regions along the horizontal axis boosting 1-axis tracker performance. The montages in Supplementary Figs. 1, 2 indi- cates the range of light-trapping performance for simple symmetrical grooves. Some convincing experimental work supporting the strong potential of the cross-grooved approach was reported33 not long after the beyond Lambertian light trapping properties of perpendicular grooves had ﬁrst been simulated20. Experimental absorption proper- ties of bare wafers with different texture combinations on front and rear were reported with cross-grooves showing appreciably stronger long wavelength absorption compared to randomly textured surfaces both sides and textured top, planar rear geometries. The advantage for perpendicular light was shown to be equivalent to an extra 1 mA/cm2 increase in current output for a 150 micron thick cell compared to the both sides textured case. Wavelength-scale texture 2-D gratings (Fig. 7a) using wavelength-scale features provide another light-trapping approach34. Perpendicular light boosts reaching 4 πn2 are calculated using square matrix layout, increasing to 8πn2/ ﬃﬃﬃ 3 p for hexagonal34. Unlike cross-grooves, boosts are very wavelength and Fig. 4 | Projected irradiance onto the unit circle for sunlight tracking systems. a Ideal 2-axis tracker conﬁning direct and 2.9o circumsolar radiation to the unit circle centre. b Ideal 1-axis tracker on EW-axis, with a simple direct and circumsolar irradiance pattern moving E to W across the unit circle. c More common 1-axis tracker on NS-axis, with projected sun-paths latitude dependent, moving N to S across the module and back (northern hemisphere), shown both for 40o latitude and at the equator (dashed sun positions, giving smallest sun-path). d 1-axis tracker on NS-axis (latitude 40o) with backtracking25 to prevent adjacent module shading.

The weaker diffuse component is blue-rich with infrared radiation in the 9501200 nm range beneﬁting correspondingly less from light-trapping.

Averaging results over the wavelength range of interest (Fig. 7b) removes this difﬁculty, again indicating good general purpose response. A series of recent papers3537 report exceptionally high perfor- mance from periodically textured device simulations, exceeding above theoretical bounds. Z factors over 100,000 are involved, resulting in simulated efﬁciencies also over 30%. These unphysical results have been traced to premature termination of the ﬁnite difference time domain (FDTD) simulation approach used, resulting in temporarily trapped light being treated as absorbed. Bifacial cells An additional cross-groove feature is suitability for bifacial cells, representing 90% of present cell production24. These are used either in monofacial modules, largely on rooftops, with detached rear reﬂectors included in cell encapsulation, or increasingly in transparent-backsheet bifacial modules for ﬁeld installation, account- ing for expected 63% module market share24 in 2024. Since light can escape from 2 surfaces, bifaciality halves the 4 n2 light-trapping average value, reducing the conventionally calculated limiting efﬁciency bound to 29.0%, reached with slightly thicker cells (130170 μm thick). This highlights the future importance of matching cell angular response to sunlight directionality to maintain high efﬁ- ciency while reducing cell thickness to 100 μm. With standard cross-groves, symmetry dictates identical angular response on both surfaces (rotated 90o) hence projected area averages are 2 n2 on each. With less symmetric structures, say with different groove angles or spacing on each side (Supplementary Information Fig. 2), the more important front-side Z can be boosted at the expense of the rear-side. Discussion We show that, to reach limiting performance, cells must exploit sun- light directionality in their targeted application. Present power plant applications are divided roughly 40%60% between ﬁxed-tilt and 1-axis tracking24, with different cell designs likely ideal for each, rather than merely different module designs as presently common. Due to increased module orientation control, 1-axis tracking provides higher potential boost, also allowing use of thinner cells. The 29.4% efﬁciency long regarded as limiting, requiring cells at least 100-μm thick, is increased to 30.1% for cells 60-μm thick or thinner, designed for these trackers. To realise such efﬁciency, past trends to increasingly sophisticated cell structures must be continued by implementing improved light-trapping. This ensures high thin-cell current, with state-of-art surface passivation already producing voltage increase for such cells15, crucial to their projected efﬁciency advantage. Methods Limiting efﬁciency calculations The maximum entropy limiting efﬁciency curves of Figs. 1c, 6c duplicate the published results of Niewelt et al.12 for intrinsic, undoped silicon cells.

First, an electron-hole (np) product is assumed, mod- elled as unform throughout the cell, allowing the corresponding cell terminal voltage V to be calculated using the bandgap narrowing theory of Schenk38 as implemented in a PV Lighthouse calculator (https://www.pvlighthouse.com.au/bandgap). For the relatively low values of n and p involved, negligible difference was found using these values and Schenks subsequently reﬁned theory39. The photogenerated current density, Jgen, is calculated at V from the photon fraction absorbed in band-to-band absorption, with most absorbed by free-carrier absorption at high voltages and long wave- lengths. From Jgen must be subtracted recombination currents due to Auger and radiative recombination in this limiting efﬁciency case. Auger recombination was calculated as in the work of Green8, con- sidering the reducing Auger recombination coefﬁcients as carrier concentrations increase. For this zero entropy case, radiative recom- bination is minimised if only a minimal amount is emitted by the cell as given by Eq.4.45 of Green40, leaving only a component of radiative recombination due to imperfect photon recycling. Note that this for- mulation already includes the effective reduction of radiative recom- bination at high carrier injection levels as noted by Fell et al. 41. For other calculations of cell performance when light-trapping values differed from 4 n2, two different approaches were used depending upon the level of detailed knowledge of the light-trapping scheme. Equation (1) of the text gives information on the allowed light- trapping values in the limit of weak absorption, with pathlength enhancement values of 4 fn2 allowed at different angles, with f values above and below unity feasible. To provide an estimate of performance for different f values, a quasi-Lambertian approach was used. Rather than allowing escape of 1/n2 of the remaining light at each surface interaction, as for the Lambertian case42, a value of 1/(fn2) was assigned, giving the correct value in the weak absorption limit while allowing the standard Lambertian calculational procedure to be used. For cases where a speciﬁc rather than generic light-trapping scheme is analysed such for the cross-groove calculation of Fig. 6c, the full pathlength distribution function27,28 is ﬁrst calculated and the cell output then calculated from this. Bifacial cells Light-trapping limits for both monofacial and bifacial cells can be derived more simply than in earlier work21 by combining the reciprocal relationship identiﬁed by Rau43 between light emission from a cell and its external quantum efﬁciency (EQE) with the van Roosbroeck- Shockley equation44. We can deﬁne the positionally and angularly weighted value of an external cell property F(rs, θ, ϕ, E) that, as for EQE, will generally be a function of surface position, rs, on surface S, alti- tudinal and azimuthal angular coordinates θ and ϕ relative to the surface normal, and photon energy, E, as: Fðrs, θ, ϕ, EÞ = R dS R π=2 0 dθ R 2π 0 Fðrs, θ, ϕ, EÞ sinθ cosθ dϕ R dSR π=2 0 dθR 2π 0 sinθ cosθ dϕ ðM1Þ Raus relationship43 for the photon emission rate/unit area from the cell becomes: Photon emission rate=unit area = 2π h3c2 Z 1 0 ðEQEf + EQErÞE2 exp½ðE  qVÞ=kT  1 dE ðM2Þ where EQEf andEQEr are the above area and angularly weighted EQE for front and rear surfaces, respectively. At each energy, this rate cannot be higher than the photon generation rate within the cell given by van Roosbroeck-Shockley equation44. Photon generation rate=unit area = 2π h3c2 Z 1 0 ð4n2αWÞE2 exp½ðE  qVÞ=kT  1 dE ðM3Þ It follows that, for all photon energies, EQEf + EQEr 4n2αW: In the weak absorption limit, in the absence of parasitic absorption, EQE equals the cell absorptance in ideal cases allowing it to be expressed in terms of the pathlength enhancement factor in this limit giving, for example, EQEf = ZfαW, and the ﬁnal result: Zf + Zr 4n2 ðM4Þ For a monofacial cell, an ideal rear reﬂector corresponds to Zr = 0, giving a slightly more generalised version of Eq. (1). For a bifacial cell with a symmetrical light-trapping scheme, such as implied by the cross-grooved scheme of Fig. 6a, Zf = Zr 2n2. An interesting and potentially important result from the above derivation is that an asymmetrical scheme need not conform to this constraint, meaning schemes where Zf2n2are possible, if Zr2n2: This means that the light-trapping performance for light incident on the all-important front of the cell can be boosted at the expense of the response of the less critical rear. Ray-tracing simulations We used the commercial software COMSOL Multiphysics with the Ray Optics module to solve the light propagation within a silicon cell given a speciﬁc surface texturing scheme. The geometric optics approach accounts for the reﬂection and refraction of light rays, assuming the texturing feature size is much larger than the wavelength [COMSOL Multiphysics Reference Manual, 6.1]. We simulated refractive index45 of 3.51 corresponding to monochromatic light at circa 1200 nm with an artiﬁcially low absorption coefﬁcient to model the weak absorption Fig. 7 | Wavelength-scale light-trapping schemes and light-trapping performance. a 2-D grating with wavelength-scale features34. b Unit circle projection of ideal grating light-trapping averaged over 9501200 nm wavelengths (grating period 950 nm).

The initial direction of travel of rays was adjusted to assess the texturing schemes pathlength enhancement at different incident angles. Effectively, we sampled 1100 different ran- dom locations and presented a position-averaged result for a given texturing design. The results remain essentially unchanged on further increasing the number of initially released rays. Due to geometrical symmetry, only a fraction of the azimuth angle range generally needs simulation with the polar angle swept from 0 (normal to surface) to 89. The silicon cell absorption at different incident angles is com- pared to that of the single path length, yielding the pathlength enhancement factor Z. The pathlength distribution function is also calculated and used in calculations of cell current output for the dif- ferent schemes. Data availability Source data are provided as a Source Data ﬁle.
