Nanostructures are ideal as anti-reflection materials due to their typically superior optical properties. The shape and size of these nanostructures are important, as optimizing them can enhance and regulate light propagation, optical absorption, and light trapping. In this paper, absorption and electrical calculations were performed using Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) and CHARGE simulations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of optimizing the shape (nanodisk, sphere, and hemisphere), aspect ratio, diameter, lattice constant, and thickness of the nanostructure. These modifications significantly improved the performance of silicon solar cells, resulting in a PCE increase by 15.27%. The optimal PCE was obtained from modifying anti-reflection using a nanodisk structure with a diameter of 300 nm, a lattice constant of 600 nm, and a thickness of 187.5 nm. The high performance is demonstrated in both optical and electrical properties, with an absorption intensity of 97% and Jsc of 49.77 mA/cm2. These superior results suggest that the proposed TiO2 nanodisk-based silicon solar cells have great potential to enhance silicon solar cell performance.

They encompass diverse types, including silicon solar cells [3], CdTe [4], GaAs [5, 6], CIGS [7, 8], and organic solar cells [9, 10].

Recent advancements have shown that multijunction solar cells can surpass the SQ limit, surpassing experimental expectations since 2009. Nonetheless, multijunction solar cells is deemed unsuitable for practical solar cell applications due to their high produc- tion costs [12]. The most viable alternatives to approaching the SQ limit are silicon and GaAs solar cells. GaAs solar cells exhibit a high PCE,however, they consist of gallium and arsenic, which are toxic materials and significantly impact the fabrication process [12]. Moreover, GaAs is a more fragile material compared to silicon, rendering the GaAs solar cell fabrication process more compliacated [13]. Among the various types of solar cells, silicon-based cells still account for over 90% of the market [14], primarily due to their maturity and reliability [15]. Continued development is being pursued for silicon solar cells with diverse structures, including passivated emitter rear contact (PERC) [1618], interdigitated back contact (IBC) [19, 20], heterostructure with intrinsic thin layer (HIT) [21, 22], and heterojunction back contact (HBC) techniques [23]. At the laboratory scale, these solar cells demonstrate the highest PCE of 26.3%, while commercially they reach an efficiency of approximately 25%. As a result, silicon solar cells are regarded as the sole solar cell material that exhibits long-term sustainability and high PCE [24]. Currently, thin- film silicon solar cells hold a distinct advantage. However, careful handling is required for thin-film silicon solar cells to prevent degradation and mechanical failures such as crack- ing. In thinner silicon solar cells, the charge carriers will benefited by a shorter travel distance [25]. However, short- circuit current density (Jsc) is expected to decrease due to the lower amount of absorption in the material. Since maximiz- ing both Voc and Jsc is crucial for enhancing power conver- sion efficiency (PCE), the ideal solar cell design aims for minimal thickness while ensuring effective sunlight absorp- tion [26]. Numerous studies have employed light-trapping techniques to maximize absorption efficiency in thin-film silicon solar cells. A recent scientific investigation introduced a nanostruc- ture-based light-trapping mechanism to enhance solar cell performance [27]. This nanostructure exhibits advantageous characteristics for solar cell utilization, including the ability to control light within the cell and an approximately 22% increase in External Quantum Efficiency (EQE) [28, 29]. Numerous studies are employing diverse forms of nano- structures in silicon solar cell applications, such as wire and pillar shapes resulted from the Ag-assisted chemical etching method. These nanostructures have demonstrated optimal light absorption percentages of 24.02% and 29.32%, respec- tively [30]. Furthermore, the nanostructure was modified into a spherical shape and incorporated into a silicon solar cell with an Al/Si/Ag structure, resulting in a PCE of 12.3% [27]. Additionally, other nanostructures, such as cones, cylinders, and parabolas were developed within the Ag/Ag nanoparticles/Si silicon solar cell structure. The findings indicate that the conical and parabolic nanostructured lat- tices exhibit higher light absorption efficiency and reduced morphology-dependent sensitivity compared to cylindrical nanostructures, making them more suitable for high-effi- ciency solar cell applications [31]. These structures were selected due to their cost reduction potential, stable process- ing, adjustable size parameters, and improved efficiency of silicon solar cells [27, 30, 31]. This finding proves the func- tionality of nanostructures in enhancing the performance of silicon solar cells. This work aims to evaluate the optical and electrical per- formance of silicon solar cells incorporating nanostructures. A two-dimensional nanostructure was placed on the silicon surface, with the arrangement of solar cells of Al/Si/TiO2 nanostructure/Ag. The modification creates an anti-reflec- tive layer utilizing the nanostructure, thereby increasing the amount of transmitted light to the silicon absorber layer and achieving optimal performance. As shown in Fig. 1a, the anti-reflective layer will change the path of incoming light to be non-perpendicular. This causes the light to be reflected repeatedly in the absorbing layer, causing a light- trapping effect [32]. When photon absorption occurs, it will Fig. 1 The arrangement of the proposed TiO2 nanostructure-based silicon solar cell. a Schematic illustration of light propagation between the anti-reflective nanostructures in solar cells, b TiO2 nano- structure-based silicon solar cells with different nanostructure shapes, including nanodisk, sphere, and hemisphere 6279 Silicon (2024) 16:62776286 produce electronhole pairs and current [4]. In addition, electrons rise to a higher energy state. Then electrons that have more energy move from the solar cell to the external circuit [33]. Different types of nanostructures are utilized specifically nanodisk, sphere, and hemisphere shapes. These specific shapes are chosen due to their potential to efficiently absorb light, resulting in a significant portion of scattered light being directed toward the substrate [34]. Furthermore, the nanostructure parameters, including lattice constants, diameters, and thicknesses, are varied to obtain an optimal photonic bandgap. Adjusting the size of the nanostructure enables the attainment of optimal performance for the solar cells [10]. The optimization is conducted using the Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) and CHARGE simulation on System Assembly and Modeling (SAM)-based application. These methods provide an optical and electrical performance simu- lation from the model built in the system which allows vari- ous parameters adjustment. The results include absorption and power-voltage (PV) curves providing insights into the optical and electrical performance of proposed nanostruc- ture-based silicon solar cells. Finally, our report successfully demonstrates a significant enhancement in PCE resulting from applying nanodisks as an anti-reflection layer com- pared to conventional silicon solar cells. 2 Method 2.1 Structure and Design The proposed silicon solar cells consist of Al/Si/TiO2 nano- structure/Ag with different functions for each layer (see Fig. 1b). Silicon (Si) acts as the light-absorbing layer, alu- minum (Al) functions as the base, silver (Ag) is used as an emitter, and titanium dioxide (TiO2) is utilized as the nanostructure material. The thickness of Si, Al, and Ag lay- ers is 2.5 μm, 1 μm, and 0.5 μm, respectively. These listed materials are well-known as commonly used solar cell com- ponents due to their suitable and excellent properties. Si has an energy bandgap of 1.12 eV, making it suitable for effec- tive light absorption. This bandgap closely matches the solar spectrum and approaches the optimal value for converting solar energy into electricity using a single semiconductor optical absorber [35]. TiO2 is selected as the nanostructure material due to its high chemical and optical stability, low cost, and corrosion resistance [36]. TiO2 nanostructures can also minimize surface reflections and increase charge ampli- fication and light scattering, thus improving overall energy harvesting capabilities [3739]. The impact of nanostructure modifications on silicon solar cells is observed by varying the shape and geometry of the applied TiO2 nanostructures. As shown in Fig. 1b, three different nanostructure shapes were applied to the silicon solar cells, including the nanodisk, sphere, and hemisphere. By comparing the absorption properties and efficiency of these three types of nanostructures, the best nanostructure will be determined and subsequently optimized for their geometric aspects, including diameter (d), lattice constant (a), and thickness (h). The ratio between the diameter and lattice constant is optimized in the variations of 1:2, 1:3, 1:4, and 2:5 to obtain the optimal nanostructure spacing. Using the best ratio, the d, a, and h are varied within 100380 nm, 200760 nm, and 110220 nm, respectively. The diameter and lattice constant variations are performed at the previ- ously obtained optimum ratio, ensuring that the spacing between nanostructures remains constant even as their sizes change. The geometric changes are made by simply inputting the parameters in the object settings in the FDTD simulation. 2.2 FDTD and CHARGE Simulation The optical performance of solar cells was simulated using FDTD methods, which allow accurate assessment of light absorption as a crucial factor in solar cell performance. In addition, the performance analysis was completed by effec- tive charge transport study CHARGE simulation which pro- vides the electrical performance. This simulation has been validated through comparison with numerical computation of uniperiodic rectangular groove-based silicon solar cells in MATLAB with an acceptable percent difference of 5.15% [40]. The simulation process in FDTD involves several steps, including defining the geometry and materials, setting the simulation regions and boundary conditions, mesh, moni- tor, and analysis groups. The parameters needed in FDTD simulation were a real and imaginary part of the material refractive index [4143]. In the FDTD simulation, the input parameters consist of the electromagnetic wave emitted from a light source ranging from 300 to 1000 nm, which is assumed as solar spectrum irradiation to the solar cells. Furthermore, the solar generation analysis group is utilized within the FDTD region to calculate the electronhole gen- eration rate. The resulting solar generation rate data is then used in the CHARGE simulation to investigate the electrical performance of the solar cells further. Further studies in CHARGE used the same model exten- sion file and generation rates obtained from the FDTD simulation the ensure accurate positioning, alignment, and optical behavior in solar cells. The electrical performance measurement in CHARGE requires the utilization of appro- priate electrical properties for the materials involved. The properties of each material used in this simulation study are listed in Table 1. In the CHARGE simulation, the diffusion doping n + + and p + + were applied only to the silicon since they were semiconductor materials. 6280 Silicon (2024) 16:62776286 The total power absorbed by the solar cell (Pabs) is the sum of the indicent light absorbed by the solar cell at each wavelength. This condition can be wtitten as an Eq. (1) shown below: with 휔 is the angular frequency of the light source, |E|2 is the electric field intensity, and im(휖) is the imaginary part of the dielectric constant, respectively. The absorption can be cal- culated using the electric field intensity, while the imaginary part of the permittivity can be calculated using the FDTD simulation. The calculation of the absorption capacity is an integral of the quantum efficiency of the solar cell, as shown in the Eq. (2). with the quantum efficiency of solar cells QE(휆) is the effec- tiveness of the cell in transferring the energy possessed by photons to electrons, mathematically it can be defined as shown in the Eq. (3). After obtaining the absorption value, using CHARGE will yield a more accurate short-circuit current density, as referenced in Eq. (4). wavelength as a substitute for the solar spectrum and IAM1.5 (λ) is the intensity of the solar radiation spectrum, respec- tively. The CHARGE simulation sweeps the voltage from 0 to 1.13 V, producing the current density (J-V) and power (PV) curves. The PCE was calculated from the ratio of the power density delivered (Pcells = J.V) to the incident power from the solar illumination AM1.5 G (PAM1.5G)). Since the simulated solar cells had an area of 1 cm2 and the AM1.5G spectrum was normalized to deliver 100 mW/cm2, the PCE was equal to Pcells as shown in the Eq. 5: (1) Pabs = 0.5휔|E|2im(휖) (2) Abs (휆) = QE(휆)d휆=  0.5|E|2im(휀) Pin(휆) =  휋|E|2im(휀) 휆Pin (휆) d휆 (3) QE(휆) = Pabs(휆) Pin(휆) (4) Jsc = e hc휆Abs(휆)IAM1.5(휆)d휆 3 Results and Discussion 3.1 The Effect of Nanostructure Shape In our study, nanostructure studies on silicon solar cells were first carried out by varying the shapes, including nanodisk, sphere, and hemisphere. The shape of the nanostructure can affect the optical and electrical characteristics of the light-trapping layer because each nanostructure shape has a different amount of light scattered into the substrate. To observe the effect of light absorption on silicon solar cells, nanodisk, spherical, and hemispheric nanostructures were applied using FDTD and a nanostructure geometry that has a d = 225 nm, a = 500 nm, and h = 187.5 nm so that the absorp- tion effect on silicon solar cells can be observed in each structure [35]. The results from FDTD depicted that silicon solar cells with nanodisk structures exhibit superior absorption com- pared to those employing spheres and hemispheres, as shown in Fig. 2a. At a wavelength of 300 nm, the absorption is quite low, with an absorption of about 54.3%. This can be attributed to the difficulty of absorbing energy within the ultraviolet light range [48]. The nanodisk solar cells demon- strate optimal absorption within the range of 700  750 nm, achieving an absorption rate of 84%. Similarly, the hemi- sphere and sphere structures also exhibit optimal absorption at this wavelength, with an absorption intensity of around 80%. The higher absorption intensity in nanodisks is attrib- uted to their efficient light transmission into the substrate [49]. Furthermore, TiO2 with nanodisk morphology dem- onstrates efficient electron transfer, thus effectively reducing electronhole recombination. Therefore, the charge carriers can effectively generate photo-currents [50]. On the other hand, the spherical structure of spheres and hemispheres allows for light capture at a wide incident angle. However, this results in imperfect reflection, leading to a 4% loss of reflected light and a subsequent reduction in absorption and effectiveness [50]. Additionally, in wavelengths higher than 800 nm the absorption was decreased with the intensity of 24.7%. This caused by the challenging nature of energy absorption within the infrared wavelength range [48]. Con- sistent with the optical performance, the nanodisk-modified silicon solar cell structure performed superior electrical characteristics, particularly Jsc, which reaches 36.28 mA/cm2 compared to alternative configurations, as shown in Table 2. This result highlights the optimal performance of solar cells when incorporating a nanodisk structure. Moreover, these (5) PCE = Pcells PAM1.5G  100% = Pcells, mWcm2 100mWcm2  100% = Pcells, mW cm2 (%) Table 1 Electrical properties materials applied in the TiO2 nanostruc- ture based-silicon solar cells, these properties were used for the simu- lation in CHARGE Materials Material Type Work Func- tion (eV) Dielectric Constant Ref Si Semiconductor 4.2 11.7 [40, 44] Al Conductor 4.28 - [45, 46] TiO2 Insulator - 80 [44, 47] 6281 Silicon (2024) 16:62776286 nanodisk-modified silicon solar cells yield a higher PCE of 18.83% compared to other proposed structures, as depicted from the power densityvoltage (PV) characteristics in Fig. 2b. Meanwhile, the sphere and hemisphere structures exhibit the same power density. 3.2 Optimization of Nanostructure Size The previous discussion identified nanodisk as the optimal nanostructure for light trapping in silicon solar cells. The nanodisk nanostructures can enhance absorption across a wide range of wavelengths, making them effective light trap- pers. Their optical absorption capability aligns with their strong electrical properties, as evidenced by their higher PCE. In this section, the discussion focused on optimizing of nanodisk structure based on several geometric parameters, including diameter (d), lattice constant (a), and thickness (h). The influence of geometry on nanostructures has been reported in various studies where some report that the larger the nanostructure, the more photons are absorbed and causes an increase in the absorption [10]. Conversely, changes in lattice constants also impact solar cell performance, as greater lattice constants lead to decreased absorption ability [10]. Therefore, it is essential to maintain the ratio between the diameter and lattice constant during the optimization process. This approach ensures that the spacing between nanodisks remains consistent, even as adjustments are made to these parameters. The diameter should be smaller than the lattice constant to prevent overlap between the nanodisks when determining the optimal ratio. Figure 3a illustrates the absorption spectra for variations in ratios of d:a that exhibit similar values, ranging between 95 and 97%. Because it is difficult to observe the absorp- tion curve for the optimal ratio, the Jsc and PCE values are utilized to determine the most favorable ratio, as shown in Table 3. The ratio of 1:2 demonstrates the highest Jsc value of 48.31 mA/cm2. This finding is further supported by the PV curve displayed in Fig. 3b, which indicates that the ratio of 1:2 yields higher PCE values compared to other ratios, with a value of 25.40%. Consequently, the 1:2 ratio is the most optimal and can be applied to nanostructure designs for further research. By employing a diameter ratio of 1:2, the nanostructure is effectively optimized. As demonstrated in Fig. 3c, the absorption values for dif- ferent d and a do not significantly change. In certain wave- length ranges, such as around 350370 nm, 550620 nm, and 700750 nm, an increase in absorption from 80 to 97% was observed. At a wavelength range of 500650 nm, the absorption is notably higher for a diameter of 300 nm and a lattice constant of 600 nm, reaching around 97% with a Jsc of 49.77 mA/cm2, as shown in Table 4. This trend is con- sistent with the PV trend in Fig. 3d, where the highest effi- ciency is observed in a nanostructure with a d = 300 nm and a = 600 nm, yielding an efficiency value of 26.14%. There- fore, it can be concluded that this specific nanostructure size is optimal for application in silicon solar cells. Then Fig. 3e demonstrates that the average absorption remains at 96% for thicknesses (h) less than 187.5 nm, while for h exceeding 187.5 nm, the average absorption increases to 96.8%. Besides the high absorption value, the Jsc value of the nanostructure with a h = 187.5 nm has a higher value than the others, as shown in Table 5. This shows that a h of 187.5 nm exhibits a high power Fig. 2 Comparison of the performance of silicon solar cells with different structures a absorption spectra obtained from FDTD simulation; and b power densityvoltage (PV) characteristics obtained from CHARGE simulation Table 2 Electrical performance of silicon solar cells with different shapes of nanostructure Shape Jsc (mA/cm2) PCE (%) Nanodisk 36.28 18.83 Hemisphere 32.05 16.48 Sphere 31.89 16.42 6282 Silicon (2024) 16:62776286 density and efficiency, as depicted in Fig. 3f. This value is appropriate since the nanostructure size impacts opti- cal and electrical performance. When the nanostructure size is excessively large, the photogeneration on the absorber layer experiences reduced mobility due to the increased distance, ultimately leading to a decrease in the PCE of solar cells [39]. The optimization of the nano- disk nanostructure, with a d = 300 nm, a = 600 nm, and h = 187.5 nm, demonstrates enhanced optical and electrical Fig. 3 The absorption spectra and PV curve of silicon solar cells with different ratios of d:a (a, b), variation of diameters (d) and lattice con- stant (a) at constant ratios (c, d), and variation of nanostructure thicknesses (h) (e, f) Table 3 Electrical performance of silicon solar cells with different d:a ratio of nanostructure Diameter (nm) Lattice Con- stant (nm) Ratio Jsc (mA/cm2) PCE (%) 225 450 1:2 48.31 25.40 225 675 1:3 40.88 21.31 225 900 1:4 36.93 19.14 450 1125 2:5 35.32 18.23 6283 Silicon (2024) 16:62776286 performance in solar cells compared to those without nanostructures. Figure 4a shows the comparison of the absorption inten- sity of the proposed silicon solar cells with and without nanodisk structures. It is evident from the figure that solar cells with nanostructures provide more light absorption compared to conventional solar cells, with an increase of 19.4%. Furthermore, the Jsc indicated an enhancement in electrical performance by 28% to reach 49.77 mA/cm2. This increase in optical and electrical properties contribute to a corresponding improvement in power density and efficiency, as shown in Fig. 4b. Conventional solar cells just achieve an efficiency of 10.87% which is much lower than the nanodisk- based silicon solar cells with an efficiency of 26.14%. The functionality of nanodisk structure in light trapping was confirmed by the electromagnetic field profile shown in Fig. 5a and b respectively. It can be observed that the inten- sity of the electromagnetic field is higher in silicon solar cells incorporating nanostructures. This signifies more pho- tons are absorbed within the nanostructured region, leading to a higher energy density in the electromagnetic wave field. The increased photon absorption subsequently contributes to higher absorption values and enhanced energy conver- sion efficiency (PCE) in the solar cells. These findings dem- onstrate that utilizing TiO2 nanodisk structure is an excel- lent choice for thin-film silicon solar cells, as it effectively Table 4 Electrical performance of silicon solar cells with different d and a of nanostructure Diameter (nm) Lattice Con- stant (nm) Jsc (mA/cm2) PCE (%) 220 440 34.33 17.72 260 520 34.45 17.78 300 600 49.77 26.14 340 680 34.37 17.72 380 760 34.35 17.70 Table 5 Electrical performance of silicon solar cells with different h of nanostructure Thickness (nm) Jsc (mA/cm2) PCE (%) 170 34.22 17.65 180 34.45 17.76 187.7 49.77 26.14 190 34.58 17.83 210 35.21 18.17 Fig. 4 Comparison of solar cell performance a Optical absorption, b PV curve of solar cells without nanostructures (flat) and solar cells using optimized nanodisk structure Fig. 5 The absorption distribu- tion profile of the electromag- netic field with a wavelength of 600 nm in solar cells a without nanostructure and b with nano- structure 6284 Silicon (2024) 16:62776286 improves both the optical and electrical performance com- pared to previous research presented in Table 6. 4 Conclusion In this work, we successfully investigated the performance improvement of TiO2 nanostructure-based silicon solar cells using FDTD and CHARGE simulations. The results show that silicon solar cells with nanostructures enhance optical absorption and overall PCE. The different shapes of the nano- structure give different characteristics of light scattering and light trapping features, thus significantly influencing the per- formance of silicon solar cells. The modification uses a nano- disk shape with a ratio of 1:2, a diameter of 300 nm, a 600 nm lattice constant, and a thickness of 187.5 nm, resulting in the highest performance of silicon solar cells. Compared to the sphere and hemisphere structures, which have detrimental light absorption due to higher reflection, the nanodisk is ben- eficial because it is more efficient in transmitting light into the Si layer. The TiO2 nanostructure modification is proven to improve the performance of silicon solar cells by provid- ing an increase in the performance of solar cell absorption by around 97%, 49.77 mA/cm2 of Jsc, and 26.14% of PCE.
