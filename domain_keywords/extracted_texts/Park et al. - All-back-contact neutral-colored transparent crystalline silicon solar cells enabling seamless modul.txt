However, the practical application still faces numerous hurdles. Foremost among these is the development of a transparent solar module. We have addressed the inherent aesthetic challenges of modularizing TSCs by integrating an all-back-contact design into the transparent crystalline silicon solar cells and creating a metal wire-free transparent solar module. This breakthrough study enabled the implementation of a 16 cm2-sized high-efficiency transparent solar module without any opaque or heterogeneous elements throughout the module (efficiency = 14.7% @ transmittance = 20%). Moreover, we have validated the practicality of the module by successfully conducting smartphone light charging under natural sunlight using this transparent solar module.

Edited by John Rogers, Northwestern UniversityEvanston, Evanston, IL; received March 5, 2024; accepted July 3, 2024 Transparent solar cells (TSCs) hold substantial potential as continuous energy gener- ators, enabling their use in situations where conventional devices may not be feasible. However, research aimed at modularizing TSCs for the purpose of regulating the overall voltage and current they produce, a critical step toward practical application, is still in its nascent stages. In this study, we explored a custom-designed, all-back-contact (ABC) configuration, which situates all electrical contacts on the rear side, to create glass-like transparent crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar cells and seamless modules. The ABC design not only demonstrates high power conversion efficiency (PCE) in solar cells but also ensures unobstructed visibility through transparent solar modules. Notably, ABC-transparent c-Si solar cells achieved a peak PCE of 15.8% while maintaining an average visible transmittance of 20%. Through seamlessly interconnecting the unit cells, the output voltage and power were systematically tuned from 0.64 V and 15.8 mW (for a 1 cm2-sized unit cell) to 10.0 V and 235 mW (for a 16 cm2-sized module). Furthermore, we successfully demonstrated the photocharging of a smartphone using a transparent ABC solar module. transparent solar cell | crystalline silicon | all-back-contact | seamless modularization | transparent solar module Transparent solar cells (TSCs) offer great promise in extending the use of solar energy in everyday life. TSCs have the potential to replace conventional windows in buildings and vehicles, where the use of traditional opaque solar cells is not feasible (1, 2). To make TSCs practical for these applications, they must be visually homogeneous, seamlessly integrated, and aesthetically pleasing. Consequently, there is a growing interest in developing neutral- colored TSCs that resemble clear glass. Among these, TSCs based on crystalline silicon (c-Si) are considered the best candidates for commercialization due to their potential to meet all the necessary criteria, including high stability, efficiency, and a glass-like appearance (1, 3, 4). The neutral-colored c-Si TSCs have achieved an impressive efficiency of 14.5% with a trans- mittance of 20%, making them the most efficient among all neutral-colored TSCs developed thus far (4). However, there is a challenge when it comes to the output voltage of the c-Si TSC unit device, which is only approximately 0.6 to 0.7 V, insufficient to charge common electronic devices that typically require at least 5 V (5). Therefore, the development of TSC modularization is imperative for practical use in daily electronic devices. A conventional c-Si SC features metal electrodes on both the front and rear sides. Modularization is achieved by interconnecting these metal wires that run the front elec- trode of one solar cell and the rear electrode of adjacent solar cells. However, this approach presents some challenges. The relatively wide (3 to 5 mm) metal wires used for intercon- nection become visible on the solar modules surface, negatively affecting the aesthetics of transparent solar modules (6). Additionally, there is a need for a physical gap of at least 2 mm to interconnect individual unit cells, which results in a loss of power density in the solar modules (7). In contrast, an all-back-contact (ABC) design, where all the electrodes are positioned on the rear side, offers a fundamental solution to these issues (8, 9). Unlike the conventional design with electrodes on both the front and rear, the ABC design eliminates the need for a physical gap between two unit cells for modularization. This is because all the electrodes are located on the rear side (10, 11). Furthermore, due to its seamless configuration, these solar cells can be interconnected using a continuous metal film rather than the conventional metal wires with a width of 3 to 5 mm. This results in a seamless solar module that closely resembles a single-body structure. Moreover, the ABC structure inherently eliminates shading losses caused by the front electrodes. This has the potential to improve the efficiency of TSCs. Herein, we present an ABC c-Si TSC and a module that represents a groundbreaking approach to overcome the inherent aesthetic limitations of transparent solar modules.

This eliminates the need for metal wire interconnections during modularization, overcom- ing the aesthetic limitations. Initially, we designed and fabricated an ABC c-Si TSC employing both an optimized rear emitter/BSF configuration and a microhole-based light-transmitting structure (3). The ABC TSCs exhibited a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 15.8% (open-circuit voltage (Voc): 638 mV, short-circuit current density (Jsc): 31.0 mA/cm2, and fill factor (FF): 80.1%) with a transmittance of 20% and a size of 1 cm2. Notably, the fabricated 16 cm2 ABC transparent solar module demonstrated an overall efficiency of 14.7% (transmittance = 20%), offering clear visibility in a single-body device. Furthermore, by increasing the number of interconnected cells, the output voltage of the module was systematically controlled from 1.27 V (two cells) to 10.0 V (16 cells), enabling a customized transparent solar module design for specific applications. To assess the practical reliability of the trans- parent solar module, we monitored the output power variation for 12 h (from 09:00 AM to 09:00 PM) under outdoor illumina- tion conditions. The transparent solar module retained approxi- mately 90% of its output power compared to that under artificial 1 SUN conditions during daytime. In addition, we successfully demonstrated the photocharging of a smartphone using a trans- parent solar module under outdoor sunlight illumination, con- firming its potential as a continuous power source. Results and Discussion Design and Development of ABC c-Si TSCs. This study develops ABC c-Si TSCs and modules. The implementation of the ABC design in c-Si TSCs results in two effects. First, the ABC design enhances device efficiency by reducing optical and electrical losses. This reduction results from the absence of a doping layer and electrodes on the front side of the ABC TSCs. Second, the ABC design enables seamless modularization, facilitating the manufacturing of transparent solar modules without compromising the visibility of TSCs during the device interconnection process. The light-transmitting areas of the c- Si TSCs must be considered when designing ABC structures optimized for c-Si TSCs and the transparent solar module. Therefore, this design differs distinctly from other general ABC solar cell designs (12, 13). The ABC TSCs were designed with a hybrid configuration that incorporated microhole arrays, interdigitated emitter, and back-surface field (BSF) layers on the rear side (Fig. 1A). In ABC c-Si TSCs, the emitter area must exceed the BSF area because the emitter region is crucial for minority carrier separation and collection, ensuring the production of photocurrent for the device (9, 13). For the optimized design, the emitter and BSF area ratios were set at approximately 3:1 (13), regardless of the position of the microhole arrays in both the emitter and BSF regions. The design parameters in microhole- based TSCs, such as diameter and spacing, play an important role pertaining to the visibility through/of microholes. The diameter of a microhole should be at least 90 µm to transmit all visible wavelengths without diffraction. To ensure that the microholes are invisible to the human eye, the spacing between microholes should be provided such that the angle between the human eye and microhole spacing is less than 1 arcminute (3). In ABC TSCs, based on the requirements for design, the microhole diameter and spacings have been chosen as 126 and 124 µm (based on a transmittance of 20%), respectively (see more details in SI Appendix, Text, and refer to SI Appendix, Table S1 for microhole diameters and spacings based on the filling fraction of silicon). To utilize the optimized design of microhole arrays in an ABC structure, the fabrication of ABC TSCs involves the following key processes: 1) formation of isolated emitter and BSF layers on the rear side, 2) designed patterning and etching of microhole arrays, 3) formation of passivation and antireflection layers, and 4) deposition of rear electrodes. The detailed fabrication process is described in SI Appendix, Materials and Methods and Fig. S1. Consequently, ABC TSCs were fabricated, as shown in Fig. 1B. ABC TSCs with isolated metal electrodes for each emitter and a BSF layer on the rear side were successfully fabricated without metal shading at the front (Fig. 1 C and D). Additionally, the light transmittance of ABC TSCs can be easily adjusted by controlling the filling fraction, which is the ratio of the silicon area (excluding the microhole area) to the total area. The filling fraction was controlled within the range of 50 to 80% by adjusting the diameter and spacing of the microholes (Fig. 1E and SI Appendix, Text). This is confirmed by the total transmittance (diffuse and specular transmittance) and photographs (Fig. 1 F and G). The measured total transmittance exhibited no wavelength cutoff within the entire range of 300 to 1,100 nm, resulting in ABC TSCs displaying a neutral color regardless of the filling fraction. Furthermore, the neutral-color properties of the ABC TSCs were quantified using the CIE 1931 chromaticity diagram. The corresponding coordinates of the ABC TSCs with transmittances of 20%, 30%, 40%, and 50% were close to the standard daylight illuminant D65 (0.3127 and 0.3290, respectively), representing the neutral color point in the CIE coordinates (Fig. 1H and Table 1). Moreover, we have demonstrated the potential for systematic control of transmittance, as well as the feasibility of designing neutral-colored ABC TSCs with transmittance values ranging from 10 to 70% (SI Appendix, Table S1). Performance of ABC c-Si TSCs. ABC TSCs hold the potential for achieving a higher PCE compared to conventional front- and rear-contact TSCs due to their unique device structure. In the conventional structure, the emitter layer and front electrodes are situated on the front side of the device, while the BSF layer and rear electrodes are located on the rear side of the device (Fig. 2A). In contrast, the ABC structure incorporates the emitter and BSF layers, along with all the metal electrodes, exclusively on the rear side of the solar cells (Fig. 2B). The ABC design eliminates shading losses caused by the front electrode. To assess the optical gain of the ABC TSCs, the reflectance (R) spectra of both the device structures were measured using a UVVis/NIR spectrophotometer (Fig. 2C). The ABC TSCs exhibited an approximately 2.3% reduction in reflectance compared with conventional TSCs in the range 300 to 800 nm. Regarding the front microgrid electrodes used in conventional TSCs, they contribute to a shading loss of approximately 2%, explaining the consistent results mentioned earlier (SI Appendix, Fig. S2) (14). However, the total transmittance (T) spectra showed no variation depending on the device architectures because the transmittance is solely determined by the overall area of the microhole arrays (SI Appendix, Fig. S3). Consequently, the absorption (A) spectra, estimated using the equation A (%) = 100  R  T, exhibited similar enhancement trend to the reflectance spectra, indicating that the ABC TSC has more potential to improve the Jsc compared to that of the conventional devices owing to the increased absorption. To evaluate the PV characteristics of the fabricated c-Si-based ABC TSCs, current densityvoltage (JV) curves were measured under AM 1.5 G illumination (Fig. 2D). The corresponding PV parameters are listed in Table 2 as well. The c-Si TSC with the con- ventional structure achieved a Voc of 612 mV, a Jsc of 28.9 mA/cm2, an FF of 74.9%, and PCE of 13.2%. In contrast, the c-Si TSC with an ABC structure exhibited a Voc of 624 mV, Jsc of 30.2 mA/cm2, Downloaded from https://www.pnas.org by 172.245.11.115 on June 17, 2025 from IP address 172.245.11.115.

The ABC TSCs exhibited sig- nificant PV performance improvements compared to conventional TSCs. The enhanced Jsc of the ABC TSCs can be further explained by the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra and integrated Jsc obtained from the EQE data (Fig. 2 E and F). The ABC TSCs exhibited improved EQE values in the short-wavelength regions compared to the conventional TSCs owing to the synergetic effects of 1) aforementioned eliminating shading loss caused by the front electrode, and 2) suppressing ShockleyReadHall (SRH) and Auger recombination caused by the dopant impurities injected into a front surface of c-Si in the conventional structure (15, 16). To clearly identify the factors contributing to the EQE improvement of ABC TSCs in the short-wavelength region, we analyzed the optical and recombination losses. Based on the inte- grated Jsc (shown in Fig. 2F) calculated from the EQE spectrum, it can be suggested that ABC TSCs (29.4 mA/cm2) outperform conventional TSCs (28.0 mA/cm2). This difference can be attrib- uted to 1) shading loss caused by the front electrode and 2) recom- bination loss influenced by dopant impurities in the front emitter layer. At wavelengths below 650 nm, the microgrid electrode which is used as the front electrode in conventional TSCs is prob- ably responsible for causing shading loss, as shown by the reflec- tance data in Fig. 2C. As a result, a difference in EQE can also be observed below 650 nm. In ABC TSC, the loss in integrated Jsc Fig. 1. Development of ABC c-Si TSCs. (A) Schematic showing the ABC c-Si TSC.

This additional loss can be attributed to differences in recombination loss caused by dopant impurities in the front emitter layer. In conventional TSCs, the junction depth of the front emitter layer is approximately 600 nm (3), which corresponds to the absorption depth of c-Si in the blue light regime (500 nm) (17). Therefore, the increase in EQE of ABC TSCs occurs primarily below 500 nm and can be attributed to reduced Auger and SRH recombination. Thus, the EQE response of ABC TSCs differs significantly from that of conventional TSCs below 500 nm. Owing to the influence of this additional recombination loss, the EQE response and opti- cal properties were confirmed to exhibit different trends depending on the wavelength spectrum, especially at approximately 300 nm (Fig. 2 C and E). Moreover, the reduction in recombination at the front surface caused an increase in Voc for the ABC TSCs, from Fig. 2. Photovoltaic (PV) performance of the ABC c-Si TSCs.

To quantitatively assess carrier recombina- tion influenced by dopant impurities in the front emitter layer, minority carrier lifetime and implied Voc were measured according to the device architectures. The ABC TSCs exhibited significant improvements in carrier lifetime (increasing from 209 to 352 µs) and implied Voc (increasing from 637 to 661 mV) in comparison to conventional TSCs. These results confirm the distinctions in carrier recombination stemming from dopant impurities on the front side (Fig. 2G). To further enhance the PV performance of the ABC TSCs, we implemented a localized contact design in the rear electrodes. This design was aimed to minimize the metal/Si contact area, as the metal/Si interface can act as numerous recombination sites (Fig. 2H) (19, 20). Fig. 2 IL and Table 3 illustrate the trends in the PV parameters of the ABC TSCs according to the rear metal contact design. The localized contact devices exhibited improved Voc (624 to 638 mV), and FF (79.2 to 80.1%) compared with those of the full-contact device because of the diminishing carrier recombination loss owing to the limited metal/Si contact area. Furthermore, this is confirmed by the dark JV curves in SI Appendix, Fig. S5, showing that the reverse saturation current of the localized contact device is significantly lower than that of the full contact device (21). In addi- tion, the localized contact devices exhibit a higher Jsc compared to that of the full contact device (30.2 to 31.0 mA/cm2) owing to the enhancement of the EQE spectra in the long-wavelength region, especially over 900 nm (Fig. 2M). As shown in Fig. 2L and SI Appendix, Fig. S6, the ABC TSCs with localized contact exhib- ited a PCE of 15.8%, which was higher than that of the full contact device (14.9%). TSCs should not only consider PCE, but also aver- age visible transmittance (AVT) and light utilization efficiency (LUE). The PCE, AVT, and LUE of recently reported TSCs and our ABC TSCs are summarized in SI Appendix, Fig. S7 and Table S2. Although some thin-film-based TSCs exhibit significantly high PCE and LUE, they have the disadvantage of only displaying specific colors. When comparing only neutral-colored TSCs, ABC TSCs have the best photovoltaic performance. Additionally, ABC TSCs also exhibit superior heat sinking perfor- mance and higher mechanical robustness owing to the structural advantages of microholes. First, to evaluate the heat sinking perfor- mance based on the presence or absence of a microhole structure, we examined the temperature variations of the devices with and without a microhole structure under AM 1.5 G conditions using a solar sim- ulator for 1 h. After 30 min, the temperatures of both devices reached saturation. After 1 h of light exposure, the device without a microhole structure reached a maximum of 47.1 C, whereas the device with a microhole structure reached a significantly lower maximum temper- ature of 38.2 C, demonstrating a temperature difference of approxi- mately 10 C (SI Appendix, Fig. S8 A and B). This difference can be attributed to Fouriers law of heat conduction, which states that the heat transfer rate is proportional to surface area (Eq. S8) (22). The 1 cm2-sized ABC TSCs have 36.4% larger surface area compared to that of a planar structure. As the heat transfer rate increases, heat dissipation also improves. Consequently, the device with a microhole structure demonstrates superior heat-sinking properties, resulting in lower tem- peratures under the same light exposure duration. Furthermore, to assess the mechanical properties of the microhole structure, we con- ducted a Solid Mechanics Simulation (COMSOL Multiphysics). The mechanical force in the simulation was set to 5,400 Pa, which corre- sponds to the standard conditions for mechanical load testing on solar modules (IEC 61215 10.16) (23). Mechanical load testing of a 1 cm2-sized planar structure and a microhole structure was performed under a selective vertical load. The results showed that the applied force in the planar structure is not evenly distributed, causing stress to concentrate in specific regions (SI Appendix, Fig. S9A). In contrast, the microhole structure facilitates the force to concentrate around the microholes, effectively dispersing the mechanical stress in the regions surrounding these zones (SI Appendix, Fig. S9B). As demonstrated in our preliminary research using microwires, microstructures play an effective role in reducing mechanical stress in c-Si (24). In conclusion, ABC TSCs with a microhole structure have a superior heat sinking performance and higher resistance to mechanical loads. Seamless ABC c-Si Transparent Solar Modules. Seamless transparent solar modules were fabricated using the following simple process (Fig. 3A): First, ABC c-Si TSC unit cells were arranged for module formation, and then, the UV-curable transparent polymer (NOA63) was poured onto the arranged ABC c-Si TSCs. After curing the polymer, on the opposite side, a 1-µm-thick Ag film was thermally deposited through a shadow mask to interconnect the cells in series. Consequently, seamless 16 cm2-sized ABC c-Si transparent solar modules were fabricated by interconnecting 16 cells (Fig. 3 B and C and SI Appendix, Fig. S10). The spacing of 124 µm between the holes of the adjacent ABC c-Si TSCs was designed to be the same as the spacing between the holes in a unit ABC c-Si TSC (Fig. 3 D and E). Thus, the single ABC c-Si TSC is designed to have uniform hole spacing, as well as the entire module is designed to maintain a consistent spacing between holes. Therefore, a seamless module was implemented to ensure that the module and single ABC c-Si TSCs could not be distinguished from each other. Consequently, both the front and back sides of the TSC module ensured clear visibility because of the fully covered back-contact electrode configuration (Fig. 3 F and G and Movie S1). This is a module configuration that cannot be implemented through conventional modularization which requires additional interconnecting metal wires for designing the transparent solar module (SI Appendix, Fig. S11). The currentvoltage (IV) characteristics of the ABC c-Si trans- parent solar modules were evaluated under AM 1.5 G illumination as a function of the number of ABC c-Si TSCs. As the number of ABC c-Si TSCs increased in a series connection from 1 to 16, the voltage increased from 0.64 to 10.0 V (Fig. 3H and Table 4). As the number of unit cells increased during modularization, clear visibility was consistently maintained (SI Appendix, Fig. S12). Moreover, there was a notable increase in the output power as the number of ABC c-Si TSCs increased (Fig. 3I). Consequently, the 16 cm2-sized ABC c-Si TSC modules exhibited a PCE of 14.7% (Voc = 10.0 V, Isc = 30.1 mA, and FF = 78.1%) and a power output of 235 mW. The voltage and power outputs can be further increased by increasing the number of ABC c-Si TSCs. In addition, the ABC c-Si TSCs could be connected in parallel and series to fabricate modules with high currents while retaining the same module con- figuration (Fig. 3 JL and Table 5). These results clearly indicate that the modularization of ABC c-Si TSCs offers an easy and effi- cient means of controlling both voltage and current. Besides the Table 3.

The transmittance and efficiency of the ABC TSCs and modules vary with the incident angle of light. The transmittance decreases as the incident angle increases, reaching 0% at an incident angle of 40 (SI Appendix, Fig. S13). Moreover, at an incident angle of Fig. 3.

This observation represents a considerable improvement in the efficiency retention rate compared to that of opaque solar cells. This improvement is due to the structural advantage of ABC TSCs, allowing light to be absorbed by the microhole walls at a wider range of incident angles. Furthermore, the characteristics of the ABC c-Si TSC module exhibit the same angle dependency as that of the ABC TSC unit since there are no structural differences (SI Appendix, Fig. S14).

To demonstrate the long-term stability of the ABC c-Si transparent solar modules under outdoor conditions, the Vocprofiles of the modules were continuously measured for 100 h using a real-time voltage-monitoring system (Fig. 4A). As shown in Fig. 4B, the Voc values of the ABC c-Si transparent solar modules remained consistently reliable over the 100-h period, demonstrating the high stability of the modules. Moreover, to explore the practical applications of the ABC c-Si transparent solar modules, photocharging of a smartphone (Galaxy Note 9, SM- N960, rated voltage: 5 V) using a transparent solar module was demonstrated (Fig. 4 CE and Movie S2). Consequently, the ABC c-Si transparent solar module successfully charged a smartphone as an electrical power source under natural sunlight illumination. This impressive demonstration highlighted the potential use of these modules as power-generating glasses (Fig. 4E). To comprehensively evaluate the outdoor performance of the ABC c-Si transparent solar modules, we conducted outdoor test- ing on the rooftop testing site at UNIST. The setup for the out- door testing is depicted in Fig. 4F. This assessment occurred on April 17, 2024, with an average daytime ambient temperature of 20 C. We employed a PV Analyzer (PROVA-200A) to assess the PV performance, which included operating voltage, current, and power, of the ABC c-Si transparent solar modules. The outdoor test extended from 8:00 AM to 8:00 PM, encompassing a 12-h Fig. 4. Demonstration of ABC c-Si transparent solar modules. (A) Photograph of the real-time voltage monitoring system setup.

Downloaded from https://www.pnas.org by 172.245.11.115 on June 17, 2025 from IP address 172.245.11.115. 8 of 9 https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2404684121 pnas.org period. Due to the dynamic nature of outdoor conditions, such as varying solar radiation and ambient temperature, the PV per- formance fluctuated in real time. Notably, during peak hours (12:30 PM), the output power of the ABC c-Si transparent solar modules in outdoor conditions remained consistently above 90% (216 mW) of the initial output power (235 mW) measured under artificial 1 SUN conditions. This decrease in output power during peak hours could be attributed to variations in solar irradiation, influenced by the changing incident angle and an increase in device temperature under continuous exposure to sunlight (as illustrated in Fig. 4G) (25). Furthermore, the output power of ABC c-Si transparent solar modules ceased after 7:00 PM due to the absence of sunlight. However, the output voltage profile shows that the output voltage starts decreasing later than the output current when the solar irradiance decreases. This is because the current decreases linearly, whereas the voltage decreases logarith- mically with decreasing solar irradiance (Fig. 4G) (26). These findings highlight that the PV parameters of the ABC c-Si trans- parent solar modules responded consistently to real-time solar radiation under actual outdoor conditions, mirroring the perfor- mance trend typically observed in conventional solar modules (27). Consequently, the practical usability of the transparent solar modules was unequivocally verified through demonstrations of smartphone charging and outdoor power output monitoring. Conclusion This study has successfully demonstrated the creation of highly efficient, neutral-colored c-Si TSCs and seamless transparent solar modules by implementing a customized ABC design. The ABC TSCs achieved an impressive PCE of 15.8%, all while maintaining an AVT of 20%. Most notably, we have achieved a seamless ABC transparent solar module with such clear visibility that it closely resembles a monolithic structure. This showcases the exceptional transparency of the ABC transparent solar module, to the extent that it is challenging to differentiate it from conventional glass. When interconnected in series, the ABC transparent solar module, composed of 16-unit cells, exhibited an overall efficiency of 14.7%. Furthermore, as the number of ABC TSCs interconnected in series increased from 1 to 16, the voltage and power output were systematically adjusted, ranging from 0.64 V and 15.8 mW (1 cell) to 10.0 V and 235 mW (16 cells). In addition to these achievements, outdoor performance reliability tests and the suc- cessful photocharging of smartphones using the ABC transparent solar modules under outdoor conditions confirm their practicality and usability under natural sunlight. This study represents a sig- nificant advancement in the development of transparent solar modules as stable and continuous power sources. To advance practical usability, it is anticipated that the PCE of ABC TSCs and modules can be enhanced by introducing light-scattering structures (e.g., pyramidal structure, microwires) on the front of the solar cells to enhance Jsc and adopting commercial-levelhigh- quality passivation techniques to improve Voc. Moreover, since all processes except the microhole formation process are identical to commercial solar cell manufacturing, it is expected that large-scale commercial-grade TSCs will be capable for building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) applications. Materials and Methods Fabrication of Conventional Transparent c-Si Solar Cells. The emitter and BSF layers were formed using the spin-on-dopant (SOD) method. At first, the phosphorus source (P509, Filmtronics) was spin-coated on a dummy Si wafer. Subsequently, it was baked on a hot plate at 200 C for 20 min to remove the organic solvent. A BSF layer was formed by placing the rear side of the c-Si wafer facing the P509-coated dummy wafer. A diffusion doping process was then carried out in a tube furnace in a mixed atmosphere of N2 (500 sccm) and O2 (125 sccm) at 880 C. Phosphorus silicate glass, which formed during the SOD diffusion pro- cess, was then removed using buffered oxide etchant (BOE). After removing the phosphorus silicate glass, an emitter layer was formed on it using a boron source (B155, Filmtronics). The B155 source was spin-coated on a dummy Si wafer and then baked at 200 C for 20 min. The front side of the wafer was placed facing the B155-coated dummy wafer. A diffusion doping process was then carried out in a tube furnace in a N2 atmosphere (500 sccm) at 880 C. Microhole arrays were fabricated on the doped wafer using photolithography and the deep reactive ion etching (DRIE, Tegal 200) method. To remove the RIE-induced surface damage, the doped wafer was wet-chemically treated by immersing it in an HF/HNO3/ CH3COOH (HNA) solution (RSE-100, Transene) for 10 s. A 10-nm-thick Al2O3 layer was deposited on the front side of the wafer as a surface passivation layer via atomic layer deposition (Lucida D100, NCD). Postannealing of the sample was performed in a tube furnace under 500 sccm in a mixed atmosphere of Ar/H2 (96:4) at 500 C for 30 min. In addition, a 60-nm-thick SiNx layer was deposited via plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PEH-600, Sorona) as an antireflection coating. A photolithography process was carried out using AZ9260 photoresist to develop a microgrid electrode as the top electrode. The electrodes on the top and bottom were formed by depositing 3-nm-thick Cr and 500-nm-thick Ag films using a thermal evaporator. Fabrication of ABC Transparent c-Si Solar Cells. The ABC transparent c-Si solar cells were fabricated using p-type Si wafers (float zone p-type) with a resistivity of 1 to 3 Ω cm and a thickness of 150 μm. Each cell had an interdigitated emitter and a back surface field (BSF) on the back side, created through the selective area diffu- sion of phosphorus and boron. Elemental doping was performed using patterned SiO2 diffusion barriers with a thickness of 900 nm. Plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PE-CVD; PEH-600, SORONA, Anseong-si, South Korea) was used to coat both the front and rear sides of the Si substrate with a 900-nm-thick SiO2 film. To create a patterned diffusion barrier for emitter contact, the SiO2 film on the backside of the substrate underwent photolithography and SiO2 etch-back using a BOE solution. Subsequently, a BSF layer was formed in a tube furnace at 960 C, using a boron dopant source (B155, Filmtronics, Butler, PA, USA), under a mixed atmosphere of O2 (250 sccm) and N2 (1,000 sccm). The excess SiO2 diffusion barrier remaining after spin-on doping diffusion was removed using a BOE solution. The emitter doping was performed using the same method. After fabricating the patterned 900-nm-thick SiO2 diffusion barrier, an emitter layer was formed on the front surface of the substrate at 840 C by supplying O2 (125 sccm) and N2 (500 sccm) using a phosphorus dopant source (P509, Filmtronics). To create microhole arrays on the c-Si ABC structure, periodic microhole arrays were patterned using an AZ4330E photoresist (AZ Electronic Materials) via photo- lithography. A 600-nm-thick aluminum (Al) layer was thermally evaporated onto the photoresist pattern as a Si-etching mask. The c-Si substrates with patterned microhole arrays were etched using deep reactive-ion etching (DRIE, Tegal 200) with SF6 (450 sccm) as the etching gas and C4F8 (200 sccm) as the passivation gas at a power of 1,500 W, platen power of 100 W, and gas pressure of 45 mTorr. Following the DRIE process, the Al mask was removed using type A Al etchant for 10 min at 50 C, followed by a substrate cleaning process with a piranha solution (a mixture of sulfuric acid [H2SO4] and hydrogen peroxide [H2O2]) for 30 min. To remove the RIE-induced sidewall damage, a wet-chemical surface treatment of the transparent c-Si substrates was performed by immersing them in an HF/HNO3/CH3COOH (HNA) solution (RSE-100, Transene). A 10-nm-thick Al2O3 passivation layer was conformally deposited on the c-Si substrate by atomic layer deposition (Lucida D100, NCD), followed by annealing in a mixed atmos- phere of Ar/H2 (96:4) at 500 C with a flow rate of 500 sccm. Additionally, a 60-nm-thick SiNx layer was deposited via PECVD as an antireflection coating layer. Metal electrodes were created by photolithography to form interdigitated localized back-contact grid patterns on the emitter and BSF regions, followed by the thermal deposition of a 1-μm-thick Ag film. Modularization of ABC Transparent c-Si Solar Cells. For the modularization process, we arranged the manufactured c-Si ABC unit cells on UV-curable tape (DUV 190, DS Semicon). A transparent UV-curable polymer (NOA 63, Norland Products, Inc.) was coated on the front surface of the isolated ABC transparent c-Si unit cells Downloaded from https://www.pnas.org by 172.245.11.115 on June 17, 2025 from IP address 172.245.11.115. PNAS 2024 Vol. 121 No. 33 e2404684121 https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2404684121 9 of 9 (surface without electrodes), which were physically covered with a glass substrate (Asahi Glass, AGC Inc., Tokyo, Japan). The NOA 63/glass layer was fully cured by UV exposure for 5 min, resulting in the formation of a transparent handling substrate for transparent solar modules. The UV-curable tape behind the arranged transparent ABC unit cells was removed after 5 min of exposure to UV light. Thereafter, a selective Ag interconnection electrode was formed between the unit cells using a shadow mask via thermal evaporation to establish series or parallel interconnections. Device Characterization. We conducted a thorough characterization of the ABC transparent c-Si solar cells, examining their optical properties and electrical performance. The optical transmittance and reflectance were investigated in the wavelength range of 300 to 1,100 nm. This analysis was conducted utilizing a UVVis/NIR spectrophotometer (Cary 5000, Agilent) equipped with a 110 mm integrating sphere, which allows for the comprehensive measurement of all light, encompassing both diffuse and specular reflections from the devices. The carrier recombination effect, influenced by dopant impurities in the front emitter layer, was tested on transparent c-Si substrates using the quasi-steady- state photoconductance (QSSPC) method (WCT-120, Sinton Instruments). This method involves illuminating the transparent c-Si substrates with a constant light source and monitoring changes in photoconductance. This measurement allows for the determination of minority carrier lifetime and implied Voc. The QSSPC method provides valuable insights into the quality of semiconductor materials, which is crucial for PV applications. The JV characteristics of the ABC transparent c-Si solar cells and modules were evaluated using a solar simulator (Class AAA, Oriel Sol3A, Newport) under AM 1.5 G illumination. The incident flux was measured using a calibrated power meter and was confirmed using an NREL-calibrated solar cell (PV Measurements, Inc.). When measur- ing the JV curves of the ABC transparent c-Si solar cells and modules, we considered the device area as the total area, encompassing both the light absorption region and the light transmission area. To analyze the EQE spectra, we measured responses across the wavelength range of 300 to 1,100 nm. This was accomplished using a Xe light source coupled with a monochromator for excitation. The device temperature measurement was conducted using an Infra-Red (IR) thermal camera (Testo 870-2) and a thermocouple with a data recorder. Additionally, we monitored the voltage profile of the ABC transparent c-Si solar module over a 100-h period using a data logger (GL240, GRAPHTEC). Throughout the day, we continuously tracked the PV performance using a PV analyzer (PROVA-200A, TES Electrical Electronic Corp). Data, Materials, and Software Availability.
