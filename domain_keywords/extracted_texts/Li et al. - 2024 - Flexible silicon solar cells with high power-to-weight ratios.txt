Nature | Vol 626 | 1 February 2024 | 105 Article Flexible silicon solar cells with high power-to-weight ratios Yang Li1,2,3,5, Xiaoning Ru2,5, Miao Yang2,5, Yuhe Zheng1,5, Shi Yin2, Chengjian Hong2, Fuguo Peng2, Minghao Qu2, Chaowei Xue2, Junxiong Lu2, Liang Fang2, Chao Su1, Daifen Chen1 , Junhua Xu3 , Chao Yan3 , Zhenguo Li2 , Xixiang Xu2  & Zongping Shao4  Silicon solar cells are a mainstay of commercialized photovoltaics, and further improving the power conversion efficiency of large-area and flexible cells remains an important research objective1,2. Here we report a combined approach to improving the power conversion efficiency of silicon heterojunction solar cells, while at the same time rendering them flexible. We use low-damage continuous-plasma chemical vapour deposition to prevent epitaxy, self-restoring nanocrystalline sowing and vertical growth to develop doped contacts, and contact-free laser transfer printing to deposit low-shading grid lines. High-performance cells of various thicknesses (55130 μm) are fabricated, with certified efficiencies of 26.06% (57 μm), 26.19% (74 μm), 26.50% (84 μm), 26.56% (106 μm) and 26.81% (125 μm). The wafer thinning not only lowers the weight and cost, but also facilitates the charge migration and separation. It is found that the 57-μm flexible and thin solar cell shows the highest power-to-weight ratio (1.9 W g1) and open-circuit voltage (761 mV) compared to the thick ones. All of the solar cells characterized have an area of 274.4 cm2, and the cell components ensure reliability in potential-induced degradation and light-induced degradation ageing tests. This technological progress provides a practical basis for the commercialization of flexible, lightweight, low-cost and highly efficient solar cells, and the ability to bend or roll up crystalline silicon solar cells for travel is anticipated. Crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar cells have been the mainstay of green and renewable energy3, accounting for 3.6% of global electricity generation and becoming the most cost-effective option for new electricity gen- eration in most of the world4. Although c-Si solar cells now account for more than 95% of the market for solar cells, which usually have a wafer thickness of 150180 μm, their use is unfeasible in some extreme appli- cation scenarios, such as satellites, spacecraft and unmanned aerial vehicles, and there is a need for further weight reduction and flexibility of solar cells5. Thus, reducing the thickness of the c-Si wafer to much thinner than that in typical c-Si solar cells, and thereby incorporating the advantages of thin-film solar cells into c-Si solar cells, is the focus of much research1,6,7. However, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of all of the thin c-Si solar cells (55130 μm) studied have remained in the range of 23.2724.70% for decades813. Recently, front-back contact silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cells have become a formidable contender for the next generation of photovoltaic devices owing to their advantages in double-sided power generation, low cost and scalable production, compared to the interdigitated back contact configurations14. To further improve the performance of front-back contact SHJ solar cells on the premise of bendable thicknesses (130 μm), careful research and optimization of each technical step (passivation, doped contact layer growth, metal oxide conductive layer deposition and grid line printing), as well as effectively connecting all of the steps while avoiding unnecessary dam- age to the interfaces, are essential. Highly efficient flexible and thin SHJ solar cells On the basis of our research, c-Si solar cells of 26% PCE with thicknesses in the range of 55130 μm, possessing features of both high PCE and flexibility, can be produced. Therefore, flexibility must be taken into consideration as an important factor. We divided the c-Si solar cells into categories according to the minimum bending radius of curvature (rb): nonflexible cells (rb  63 mm) with thicknesses of 150 μm; semiflexible (SF) cells (38 mm  rb  63 mm) with thicknesses of between 100 and 150 μm; and flexible and thin (FT) cells (rb  38 mm) with thicknesses of 100 μm (thinner than a piece of A4 paper). Thus, we demonstrate the potential of c-Si solar cells to become a category of thin-film solar cells with remarkable flexibility and plasticity (Fig. 1a), the cells can undergo various deformations, such as bending and curling. By con- trast, traditional c-Si solar cells (150 μm) immediately break with a relatively small distortion. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06948-y Received: 24 October 2022 Accepted: 6 December 2023 Published online: 31 January 2024 Check for updates 1School of Energy and Power, Jiangsu University of Science and Technology, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, China. 2LONGi Central R&D Institute, LONGi Green Energy Technology Co., Ltd, Xian, Shaanxi, China. 3School of Materials Science and Engineering, Jiangsu University of Science and Technology, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, China. 4WA School of Mines: Minerals, Energy and Chemical Engineering (WASM-MECE), Curtin University, Perth, Western Australia, Australia. 5These authors contributed equally: Yang Li, Xiaoning Ru, Miao Yang, Yuhe Zheng. e-mail: dfchen@just.edu. cn; jhxu@just.edu.cn; chaoyan@just.edu.cn; lzg@longi.com; xuxixiang@longi.com; zongping.shao@curtin.edu.au 106 | Nature | Vol 626 | 1 February 2024 Article Epitaxy-preventing composite gradient passivation The first step in resolving the efficiency bottleneck of FT and SF cells is to achieve good passivating contacts. For SHJ solar cells, passiva- tion is typically implemented using intrinsic hydrogenated amor- phous silicon (i:a-Si:H) or hydrogen-rich i:a-Si:H passivation layers in conventional techniques1518, but epitaxial dendrite growth from the c-Si surface is inevitable (Extended Data Fig. 1a,b). Although oxy- gen doping is considered to be beneficial in suppressing epitaxial growth, it is associated with a decrease in the electrical properties of the passivating contacts19. In this work, a two-stage composite gra- dient passivation process was adopted to resolve this contradiction (Fig. 1b). In the first stage, 23 atomic layers of an oxygen-containing amorphous silicon subnanolayer (0.5 nm; i:a-SiOx:H (1) x  10 at%) were bifacially grown on c-Si by plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD). The ultrathin passivation layer i:a-SiOx:H (1) prevents the periodicity of the crystal arrangement of c-Si from con- tinuing outwards, while minimizing the impact of oxygen doping on the electrical properties of the passivation contacts. In the second stage, an epitaxy-free i:a-Si:H (2) passivation layer with a thickness of about 4.5 nm was intentionally coated on i:a-SiOx:H (1) to strengthen the passivation effect and isolate the subsequent doping layers. The enlarged cross-sectional morphology in Extended Data Fig. 1c high- lights the various regions of the composite gradient passivation lay- ers and demonstrates that the ultrathin oxygen-doped subnanolayer fundamentally prevented the formation of epitaxial silicon nanotwins. Compared with the traditional hydrogen-rich i:a-Si:H/a-Si:H, the i:a-SiOx:H (1)/a-Si:H (2) composite passivation layers increased the PCE by 0.34% (Fig. 2a). Low-damage continuous-plasma CVD operation We realized that the conventional discontinuous-plasma CVD process is not ideal, as the subnanolayer is vulnerable and highly sensitive to the plasma fluctuation and reignition (transient high-voltage surges). After being subjected to the stepwise PECVD procedure, i:a-SiOx:H (1) was found to have perforating defects distributed on its surface, and the peak roughness was 0.5 nm (Fig. 2b). These devastating vacancies can serve as a new foundation for c-Si epitaxial growth, impairing the passivation function of i:a-SiOx:H (1). Hence, we adjusted the commonly used step-by-step procedure to a one-step continuous-plasma CVD passivation process, so that i:a-Si:H (2) can be continuously grown on i:a-SiOx:H (1) while guaranteeing the integrity of the epitaxy-preventing i:a-SiOx:H (1) subnanolayer (Fig. 2c) and the optimal passivation effect can be obtained. Notably, the continuous process produced a naturally evolving rather than abrupt interface between the i:a-SiOx:H (1)/a-Si:H (2) composite passivation layers (Extended Data Fig. 1c), because of the gradual transition of the feed gases. The hydrogen content (CH) and microstructure factor (R*) are two key parameters influencing the pas- sivation quality, which need to be individualized in i:a-SiOx:H (1) and i:a-Si:H (2) owing to their differentiated functions. High CH is required for i:a-SiOx:H (1) to saturate dangling bonds, whereas tailoring CH for i:a-Si:H (2) focuses more on boosting the output. As a result, we can see from Fig. 2d that the effective minority carrier lifetime (τeff) climbed to FT 84-μm cell a b i:a-SiOx:H (1) x  10 at% subnanometre Epitaxial Si (nanotwins) Epitaxy prevention Low damage i:a-Si:H (2) Vertical growth nc-Si:H/nc-SiOx:H i:a-Si:H passivation a-Si:H/a-SiOx:H Crystalline Si atoms Epitaxial Si atoms Passivator Si atoms Passivator O atoms H atoms Passivator Si atoms n+/p+ junction nanocrystalline Si atoms n+/p+ junction amorphous Si atoms n+/p+ junction O atoms Self-restoring nanocrystalline sowing Thinning n:c-Si (56125 Pm) i:a-Si:H (2) (4.5 nm) n+:nc-SiOx:H (15 nm) ICO (70 nm) p+:nc-Si:H (22 nm) ICO (70 nm) Ag Ag i:a-Si:H (2) (4.5 nm) i:a-SiOx:H (1) (0.5 nm) i:a-SiOx:H (1) (0.5 nm) Gradual transition Non-ideal passivation FT 57-μm cell Fig. 1 | Schematic diagrams of the FT and SF SHJ solar cells. a, Structure schematics and photographs of the FT and SF SHJ solar cells (166  166 mm). b, Schematic diagrams of the continuous-plasma CVD composite gradient passivation, the nanocrystalline sowing and the vertical growth induction steps. During continuous-plasma CVD, the RF plasma is kept stable (fluctuation  0.5%) under the real-time monitoring and rapid-response regulation without reignition to protect the epitaxy-preventing i:a-SiOx:H (1) subnanolayer. During the composite gradient passivation, the low-damage i:a-SiOx:H (1)/a-Si:H (2) composite passivation layers with a gradual transitional interface are created through the continuous-plasma CVD process. Nature | Vol 626 | 1 February 2024 | 107 the maximum value (about 5 ms) as CH increased to 26.3% (R* 68.9%) and 19.2% (R* 20.2%) for i:a-SiOx:H (1) and i:a-Si:H (2), respectively, which was also a notable improvement over that of the conventional passivation strategies (Extended Data Table 1a). In terms of cell performance, the open-circuit voltage (VOC), fill factor (FF) and PCE all experienced the greatest gains under the optimal passivation conditions (Extended Data Fig. 2). By contrast, under the same conditions, τeff was reduced to 4.4 ms through the discontinuous-plasma CVD passivation operation (Fig. 2e), indicating degradation of the passivation effect and cell performance. On the basis of the above optimization, the cell performance is clearly com- prehensively improved through protective continuous-plasma CVD, and the average values of PCE, FF, VOC and the short-circuit current (JSC) can be further increased by 0.30%, 0.42%, 1.0 mV and 0.22 mA cm2, respec- tively, compared with those of the discrete PECVD process (Fig. 2fi). Nanocrystalline sowing and contact vertical growth Then n- and p-type carrier-selective contacts were grown by very high-frequency (VHF)-PECVD on the passivation layers, playing the roles of the electron transport layer (ETL) and hole transport layer (HTL), respectively. According to the schematic in Fig. 2j, in traditional nanocrystallization routes, the nanocrystals are randomly dispersed in the contact layers and not coherent in the longitudinal direction, clearly visible in the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image in Extended Data Fig. 3a, which impedes the carrier sep- aration and extraction efficiency2023. Instead, we used a self-restoring nanocrystalline sowing technique to induce vertical growth of doping junctions on both sides, as depicted in Fig. 1b, further reducing the electrical resistive loss and parasitic absorption loss in the direction of current flow (Fig. 2k). We discovered that using VHF CO2 plasma to treat the i:a-Si:H (2) surface can dehydrogenate it and encourage a transfor- mation of the original amorphous state (Fig. 2l) to a partially nanocrys- tallized (nc-) state, and the nanoscale crystalline seeds can be observed after the prerequisite incubation (Fig. 2m). However, the trade-off is that the crystallization process is unrestricted, causing unwanted CH loss in the bulk passivation layers as a function sowing duration (Extended Data Fig. 4c,d), and the cross-sectional HRTEM image (Extended Data Fig. 4e) testifies that if not controlled, reverse epitaxy would occur, 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2.0 2.2 Crystallinity fraction [%] 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 25.8 26.0 26.2 26.4 26.6 Crystallinity fraction [%] 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 710 720 730 740 750 760 770 Thickness (nm) 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 710 720 730 740 750 760 770 Thickness (nm) 57 μm 84 μm 125 μm 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 25.4 25.6 25.8 26.0 Crystallinity fraction [%] 3.18 4.00 4.52 4.75 4.97 5.01 4.94 4.05 4.81 5.01 4.88 4.78 4.73 4.70 10 15 20 25 30 3 4 5 Weff (ms) Hydrogen content (%) 10 15 20 25 30 3 4 5 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 2.0 2.2 2.4 2.6 2.8 3.0 Crystallinity fraction [%] 105 103 101 101 103 Conductivity (S cm1) 1  1014 1  1015 1  1016 2 4 6 8 10 Excess carrier concentration (cm3) 39.59 39.81 39.4 39.6 39.8 40.0 JSC (mA cm2) 84.73 85.15 84.6 84.8 85.0 85.2 85.4 FF (%) 747.0 748.0 746 747 748 749 VOC (mV) 25.06 25.36 25.0 25.2 25.4 Discontinuous plasma Continuous plasma 24.71 25.05 24.6 24.8 25.0 25.2 PCE (%) 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 0.4 0 0.4 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 0.4 0 0.4 a e g h f d i c b Length (μm) Height (nm) l n p Random growth k o q r s After self-restoring nanocrystalline sowing m TCO TCO T Before self-restoring nanocrystalline sowing e e ee e e e e e e e Shallow surface Nanoseed prelaid e e e e e e h+ HR i:a-Si:H/a-Si:H i:a-SiOx:H (1)/a-Si:H (2) j Self-restoring NSVGI Length (μm) Height (nm) i:a-SiOx:H (1) PCE (%) Discontinuous plasma Continuous plasma Discontinuous plasma Continuous plasma Discontinuous plasma Continuous plasma Hydrogen content (%) i:a-Si:H (2) Weff (ms) Discontinuous plasma Continuous plasma Weff (ms) VOC (mV) VOC (mV) 57 μm 84 μm 125 μm PCE (%) PCE (%) Bandgap (eV) Random growth Self-restoring NSVGI Random growth Self-restoring NSVGI Bandgap (eV) 105 103 101 101 103 Conductivity (S cm1) i:a-Si:H (2) i:a-Si:H (2) Random growth Self-restoring NSVGI Fig. 2 | Passivation and nanocrystalline contacts. a, Gain effect of i:a-SiOx:H (1)/a-Si:H (2) on the cell performance (HR, hydrogen rich). b,c, Atomic force micrographs (top) and the corresponding surface profiles (bottom) of i:a-SiOx:H (1) after the discontinuous-plasma (b) and continuous-plasma (c) CVD processes.

As a result, we implemented a new self-restoring nanocrystalline sowing technology by introducing an effectively coordinated two-component VHF plasma of H2 and CO2. The hydrogen atoms in the bifunctional plasma can spontaneously diffuse inside to restore CH (Extended Data Fig. 4c,d) while restricting the nanocrystalline sowing on the shallow surface of i:a-Si:H (2). Subsequently, the doped contact layers ger- minated and grew upwards from the prelaid nanoseeds, opening up photogenerated carrier superhighways between the upper and lower layers, and the corresponding cross-sectional HRTEM image is shown in Extended Data Fig. 3b. Ultimately, with the assistance of the self-restoring nanocrystalline sowing and vertical growth induction process, the carrier conductivities of the contact layers exponentially increased with the crystallinity fraction (XC), from 105 S cm1 in the state with a low nanocrystalline fraction to 102 S cm1 in the state with a high nanocrystalline fraction (Fig. 2n,o), approximately 12 orders of magnitude higher than those in traditional nanocrystallization routes. However, there is a trade-off for the selection of the XC values. For the front n+:nc-SiOx:H window layer, the increasing XC hampers the formation of strong SiO bonds (8.4 eV), narrowing the bandgap (Fig. 2n) and limiting the incident light transmittance. Therefore, the XC of n+:nc-SiOx:H was optimized to 43.7% when the PCE was taken into account (Fig. 2p), and the FF showed a similar trend with XC (Extended Data Fig. 4a). By contrast, the rear junction (p+:nc-Si:H) can withstand a higher crystallinity to facilitate the hole transport because the impact of incident light does not need to be accounted for. Nevertheless, a high XC hinders the boron-dopant subbands from incorporating the intrinsic band structure, which causes a rapid increase in the bandgap of the HTL and increases the transparency for the longwave transmission (Fig. 2o). Simultaneously, the moderate XC is advantageous for shortening the growth duration and maintaining the crystal coherence. Therefore, the cell performance peaked at a rear emitter crystallinity of 63.4% (Fig. 2q and Extended Data Fig. 4b). By comparison, the effects of the traditional nanocrystalline routes were much less, as shown in grey in Fig. 2p,q. In addition, the ETL and HTL layers require certain thick- nesses to generate sufficient depletion regions for carrier separation, but excess thicknesses can result in same-polarity repelling and carrier recombination. As the window layer, the n+:nc-SiOx:H ETL needs to be thinner to allow the maximum number of photons to be incident into the active layer. Therefore, after compromising the above three conditions, the thicknesses of the n+:nc-SiOx:H ETL and the p+:nc-Si:H HTL were optimized to 15 nm and 22 nm, respectively, at which the VOC curves reached the maxima, indicating the optimal electron and hole separation effect (Fig. 2r,s). Ce-doped indium oxide and laser transfer printing The passivating contacts are nondegenerate semiconductors exhib- iting low lateral conductivity, so highly degenerate transparent con- ducting oxide (TCO) layers are stacked on silicon contacts to assist in collecting carriers to electrodes. Cerium-doped indium oxide (ICO) has been attracting increasing interest for solar cell applications owing to its excellent mobility and transparency24,25. In a typical sputtering process for TCO layer deposition, the plasma ions directly bombard the sample surface, resulting in degradation of the cell performance. 50 60 70 80 90 100 110 120 130 0.8 1.0 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2.0 20 30 40 50 60 50 60 70 80 90 100 110 120 130 26.0 26.5 27.0 PCE (%) 50 60 70 80 90 100 110 120 130 40.0 40.5 41.0 41.5 JSC (mA cm2) 50 60 70 80 90 100 110 120 130 750 755 760 765 VOC (mV) 50 60 70 80 90 100 110 120 130 85.0 85.5 86.0 86.5 FF (%) Thickness (μm) 12 10 8 6 4 2 0 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 10 8 6 4 2 0 Thickness (Pm) PWR (W g1) Radius of curvature (mm) ISC = (11.013  0.12) A VOC = (0.7613  0.0032) V FF = (85.13  0.94)% Pmpp = (7.137  0.11) W K = (26.06  0.39)% e a d c g f 95% conﬁdence interval Maximum residual error: 0.11% 12 10 8 6 4 2 0 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 Voltage V (V) 10 8 6 4 2 0 Power P (W) Current I (A) 12 10 8 6 4 2 0 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 10 8 6 4 2 0 12 10 8 6 4 2 0 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 10 8 6 4 2 0 7.5 12.5 10.0 5.0 2.5 0 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 10.0 8.0 6.0 4.0 2.0 0 Acell = (273.8  1.1) cm2 Thickness: 57 μm Calmark: 002981 b Thickness (μm) Thickness (μm) Thickness (μm) 95% conﬁdence interval Maximum residual error: 0.8 mV 95% conﬁdence interval Maximum residual error: 0.08 mA cm2 Current I (A) Power P (W) Current I (A) Power P (W) Voltage V (V) Voltage V (V) Power P (W) Current I (A) Current I (A) ISC = (11.234  0.12) A VOC = (0.7529  0.0032) V FF = (86.08  0.95)% Pmpp = (7.280  0.11) W K = (26.56  0.40)% Acell = (274.1  1.1) cm2 Thickness: 106 μm Calmark: 002975 95% conﬁdence interval Maximum residual error: 0.07% ISC = (11.085  0.12) A VOC = (0.7577  0.0032) V FF = (85.42  0.94)% Pmpp = (7.174  0.11) W K = (26.19  0.39)% Acell = (273.9  1.1) cm2 Thickness: 74 μm Calmark: 002977 ISC = (11.158  0.12) A VOC = (0.7558  0.0032) V FF = (86.11  0.95)% Pmpp = (7.262  0.11) W K = (26.50  0.40)% Acell = (274.0  1.1) cm2 Thickness: 84 μm Calmark: 002979 ISC = (11.375  0.13) A VOC = (0.7514  0.0032) V FF = (86.07  0.95)% Pmpp = (7.356  0.11) W K = (26.81  0.40)% Acell = (274.4  1.1) cm2 Thickness: 125 μm Calmark: 002896 Voltage V (V) Voltage V (V) Power P (W) 1.90  0.04 Best PWR 1.47  0.04 1.47  0.04 1.47  0.04 1.31  0.03 1.31  0.03 1.31  0.03 1.04  0.03 1.04  0.03 1.04  0.03 0.89  0.03 0.89  0.03 0.89  0.03 19.6  0.5 19.6  0.5 19.6  0.5 27.6  0.5 27.6  0.5 27.6  0.5 31.0  0.5 31.0  0.5 31.0  0.5 38.5  0.5 38.5  0.5 38.5  0.5 44.9  0.5 44.9  0.5 44.9  0.5 Fig. 3 | Parameter statistics and certification reports. a, Statistical parameters of 100 cells with various thicknesses. bf, Institute for Solar Energy Research in Hamelin-certified currentvoltage (IV) and powervoltage (PV) curves of the FT and SF SHJ solar cells with thicknesses of 57 μm (b), 74 μm (c), 84 μm (d), 106 μm (e) and 125 μm (f). mpp, maximum power point. g, PWR data and flexibility of the FT and SF SHJ solar cells.

Nature | Vol 626 | 1 February 2024 | 109 In this work, we deposited ICO as the TCO coating by the low-damage reactive plasma deposition method, which produced superior electri- cal performance, including much lower resistivity (2.7  104 Ω cm) and higher carrier mobility (83.1 cm V1 s1), when compared to those of the magnetron sputtering-derived indium tin oxide (Extended Data Table 1b) and other TCOs reported elsewhere26. The TCO innovation not only contributed a 0.1% reduction in the total electrical power loss, but also played a decisive role in subsequent stability improvement. Afterwards, we strived to reduce optical loss by optimizing the con- figuration of grid lines using industry-compatible contact-free laser transfer printing (LTP) technology27. The finger width could be reduced from 40 μm (typical screen printing) to 18 μm, with the shading area controlled to less than 2%. Extended Data Fig. 5 verifies that LTP makes a great contribution to JSC and the PCE, increasing them by 0.33 mA cm2 and 0.22%, respectively. Cell performance and certification Since Sanyo suggested wafer thinning as a strategy to maximize eco- nomic benefits, researchers have been exploring ways to improve the performance of thin-wafer c-Si solar cells12; however, it remains a great challenge to break through the 26% barrier for SF, and espe- cially FT, solar cells8,13,28. Through investigation of the above mecha- nism and technical innovation, we were able to achieve efficiencies above 26% in the full range of 55130 μm, as shown in Fig. 3a, and certified by the Institute for Solar Energy Research in Hamelin. The certificates for the cells with thicknesses of 57 μm (26.06%), 74 μm (26.19%), 84 μm (26.50%), 106 μm (26.56%) and 125 μm (26.81%) are presented in Fig. 3bf, respectively (to our knowledge, the highest values so far for each thickness), whereas the control group without the above improvement steps could achieve conversion efficiencies only in the range 24.2824.72% (Extended Data Table 1c). Remarkably, the SF cell (125 μm) obtained the highest c-Si solar cell efficiency, and to our knowledge, the FT cell (57 μm) achieved the highest VOC of any c-Si solar cell, 761 mV. The importance of this work is also reflected in the power-to-weight ratios (PWRs) for each thickness (Fig. 3g). The PWR of the FT cell (57 μm) reached 1.9 W g1, which, to our knowledge, is the state-of-the-art for c-Si solar cells and more than twice that of the 125-μm SF cell (0.89 W g1). Meanwhile, the flexibility brought about by thinning was also substantially improved, allowing the cell radius of curvature to be 19.6 mm. This opens up new possibilities for drones, spacecraft and other applications that require extreme weight and flexibility. The advantages of this work can also be seen in a horizontal comparison with other types of solar cell. Extended Data Table 1d lists some representatives of different types of high-performance solar cell. Other current records are those set by Kanekas interdigitated back contact-structured solar cells (26.7%)29,30, Jinkos tunnel oxide passivated contact solar cells (26.126.4%)3133 and LONGi and Trinas passivated emitter and rear contact solar cells (24.0624.5%)34,35. External quantum efficiency and stability test The cell thinning brings two benefits, as evidenced in the absolute efficiency loss model using the theoretical limit (29.1%) as a benchmark (Fig. 4a). First, the resistance of the silicon matrix is reduced, lowering the resistive loss from 0.37% (125 μm) to 0.31% (57 μm). Second, the migration distance of the photogenerated carriers is reduced, lowering the recombination probability, and the extrinsic recombination loss decreases from 0.49% (125 μm) to 0.46% (57 μm). As a consequence, from Fig. 4b we can see that the external quantum efficiency increased with the cell thinning in the ultraviolet-to-visible (UVVis) region, on the basis of the shallow absorption depth (10 μm) of the UVVis photons. However, the absorption depths of near-infrared (NIR) light exceed the cell thicknesses (for example, 102106 μm at 1,0001,200 nm), so the external quantum efficiency in the NIR range decreased as cell thinning progressed, increasing the optical loss from 1.44% (125 μm) to 2.27% (57 μm), which is the main cause of the JSC drop with cell thinning. As shown in Fig. 4c, the NIR loss of the FT cell (57 μm) was 0.35 mA cm2 higher than that of the SF cell (125 μm), whereas the thinnest FT cell had the lowest blue (UVVis) loss, which was 0.22 mA cm2 lower than 26.5 27.0 26.5 27.0 27.5 0 50 100 150 200 24.5 25.0 25.5 26.50 26.38 26.34 26.31 26.30 26.81 26.71 26.64 26.62 26.61 24.75 24.65 24.58 24.55 24.53 PCE (%) Time (h) 26.5 27.0 26.5 27.0 27.5 0 50 100 150 200 24.5 25.0 25.5 26.50 26.38 26.40 26.40 26.81 26.73 26.69 26.71 24.75 24.62 24.60 24.58 Accumulated irradiation (kWh) 0.59 0.72 0.77 0.80 0.81 2.42 2.48 2.25 2.19 2.07 57 74 84 106 125 0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 Optical loss (mA cm2) Thickness (μm) Blue loss NIR loss 0.13 0.20 0.13 0.15 0.05 0.80 0.81 0.81 0.82 0.83 57 74 84 106 125 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 BC loss SD loss 1.35 1.08 1.07 0.97 0.80 1.20 0.96 0.97 0.81 0.73 57 74 84 106 125 0 0.5 1.0 1.5 300 400 500 600 700 800 900 1,000 1,100 1,200 0 20 40 60 80 100 EQE (%) Wavelength (nm) Integrated J (mA cm2) 0 10 20 30 40 50 26.81 26.56 26.5 26.19 26.06 0.37 0.35 0.34 0.32 0.31 0.49 0.48 0.48 0.47 0.46 1.44 1.71 1.78 2.12 2.27 25 26 27 28 29 b a d 57 Pm 74 Pm 84 Pm 106 Pm 125 Pm Absolute efﬁciency loss from theoretical limit (%) Conversion efﬁciency Resistive loss Extrinsic recombination loss Optical loss c e f Traditional SHJ 150 Pm g SF 125 Pm (26.81%) FT 84 Pm (26.50%) FT 57 Pm (26.06%) Optical loss (mA cm2) Optical loss (mA cm2) Thickness (μm) Thickness (μm) FSE loss ARC loss SF 125 Pm FT 84 Pm Traditional SHJ 150 Pm SF 125 Pm FT 84 Pm PCE (%) PCE (%) PCE (%) PCE (%) PCE (%) Fig. 4 | Quantum efficiencies, loss elements and stabilities. a, Summary of loss elements for the FT and SF SHJ solar cells relative to the practical limit (29.1%). b, External quantum efficiency (EQE) of the FT (57 and 84 μm) and SF (125 μm) solar cells. c, NIR and blue optical losses of the FT and SF solar cells. d, Shading (SD) and base collection (BC) losses of the FT and SF solar cells. e, Antireflection coating (ARC) and front surface escape (FSE) losses of the FT and SF solar cells. f, Certificated PID ageing tests. g, Certificated light-induced degradation ageing tests.

Furthermore, owing to the advanced LTP process, the shading loss was reduced to 1.7%. In addition, the base collection loss, antireflection coating loss and front surface escape loss for the 57-μm cell were also well controlled, accounting for 0.28%, 2.6% and 2.9% respectively, as shown in Fig. 4d,e. To comprehensively study the cell performance, we systematically investigated the stabilities of the FT and SF SHJ solar cells according to International Electrotechnical Commission 61215:2021 (ref. 36). After 96 h of potential-induced degradation (PID) ageing test (Extended Data Fig. 6), the power attenuation of the FT and SF cells was about 0.6% (Fig. 4f), much lower than the threshold value (5%). At the same time, we also found that the anti-PID capacities of the FT and SF cells exceeded those of the conventional SHJ cells because the reactive plasma deposition-derived ICO layer exhibited electrical properties superior to those of the conventional indium tin oxide layer, as dem- onstrated in Extended Data Table 1d and Extended Data Fig. 7a,b. Addi- tionally, in the process of light-induced degradation ageing tests, the attenuation should not be higher than 1% after an accumulated illumina- tion of 20 kWh m2. As shown in Fig. 4g, the practical power attenuation of the FT and SF cells was still 0.4% after irradiation of 210 kWh m2, which was lower than that of the conventional SHJ cells (0.67%) owing to the strengthened i:a-SiOx:H (1)/a-Si:H (2) composite passivation lay- ers and nanocrystalline n+:nc-SiOx:H and p+:nc-Si:H contacts (Extended Data Fig. 7c,d). The results presented above demonstrate that the FT and SF cells are environmentally adaptable and durable. In addition, we observed an intriguing phenomenon: light-induced degradation followed by a degree of PCE recovery, primarily due to the rebound of VOC and FF, whereas JSC remained relatively stable (Extended Data Fig. 8). The underlying causal mechanisms of the light-induced degradation are extremely complicated, and further research and in-depth study are needed. Nevertheless, according to our current research, strengthening the passivation layers and decreasing the overall amorphous degree are effective ways to reduce the impact of light-induced degradation. Another advantage of our structures is the lower cost of the raw mate- rial. According to recent SHJ solar cell cost models, every 10 μm of thin- ning brought about by the FT and SF cells can reduce silicon usage by about 7% and save about 3% in overall manufacturing cost2,3739.

The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited 2024 Methods Preprocessing As-cut 150-μm M6 size (166  166 mm  0.25) n-type Czochralski c-Si wafers were further thinned to 55130 μm for cell fabrication. The wafers were in (100) orientation with a resistivity of 13 Ω cm. The thin- ning process was conducted by immersing the wafers in 10% KOH-based solution for isotropic chemical etching. The etching duration was care- fully controlled from 180 to 1,500 s to obtain the target wafer thick- nesses. Subsequently, the wafers were textured in KOH solution mixed with additives. Pyramids featuring (111)-orientated facets and 39 μm in size were formed on both sides after texturing, followed by chemical removal with a 12% diluted hydrofluoric acid solution for stripping off native SiOx films on the wafer surface. The average thickness of each set of wafers was determined by weight measurement with an accuracy of 0.5 μm. Surface passivation The feed gases of silane (SiH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) with a flow ratio of [CO2]/[SiH4] = 0.15:1 were induced by the RF PECVD (13.56 MHz) sys- tem at 190 C to grow 23 atomic and epitaxy-preventing i:a-SiOx:H (1) subnanolayers (0.5 nm) on both sides. To avoid unwanted plasma damage during the implementation of subsequent passivation lay- ers, we installed a self-developed continuous regulation and control system (CRCS) in the CVD equipment; 5,000 diodes were integrated in CRCS as the feedback terminal for real-time monitoring of plasma bombardment intensity, particularly surface voltage, on the whole cell surface (166  166 mm), cooperating with the fine adjustment from the intelligent control system in CRCS to balance the system resistance and avoid plasma fluctuations. Therefore, we found that not only can the plasma be kept uninterrupted during the feed gas switching process, but also the plasma fluctuations can be controlled at a low level during the entire passivation process, especially important in transitional peri- ods. Then, the CO2 supply was programmatically switched to hydrogen (H2) until a flow ratio of [H2]/[SiH4] = 19:1; Extended Data Fig. 9a veri- fies that the plasma fluctuation was controlled  0.5% under precise CRCS adjustment. Subsequently, another approximately 4.5-nm-thick epitaxy-free i:a-Si:H (2) layer was coated onto the i:a-SiOx:H (1) subna- nolayers bifacially. The continuous-plasma CVD process produces a natural interface transition from the first passivation layer to the second passivation layer, and the entire passivation process protects the delicate amorphous layers from plasma damage. By contrast, conventional passivation relies on the step-by-step PECVD processes for depositing multiple layers, which are susceptible to contamination and defects (bombardment damage). For comparison with the continuous-plasma CVD process, we prepared the control group as follows. The i:a-SiOx:H (1) layers were grown in the same way as above; however, we found that without the rapid-response regulation of CRCS, the plasma fluctuation in the conventional CVD process was about 8% (Extended Data Fig. 9b), inferring that the uniformity of the resulting passivation layers is inferior to that of those produced through the continuous-plasma CVD process. More seriously, in conventional CVD passivation, switching between different feed gases causes a sud- den change of system resistance, rendering the plasma unsustainable and the RF power to cease after depositing the i:a-SiOx:H (1) subnanolay- ers. Until the feed gases were switched to the predetermined proportion of [H2]/[SiH4] = 19:1, RF plasma was reignited along with high-voltage pulses (Extended Data Fig. 9c) and the power was rematched to deposit the subsequent i:a-Si:H (2) passivation layer. Doped contacts, TCO and grid lines The doped contact layers were fabricated through self-restoring nanocrystalline sowing and vertical growth induction. The i:a-Si:H (2) surfaces were intentionally pretreated with a bifunctional plasma of CO2 and H2 mixture through VHF PECVD (40.68 MHz) for 2050 s, with a flow ratio of [CO2]/[H2] = 1:20, to sow nanocrystalline seeds and preserve hydrogen contents in the passivation layers, maintain- ing the optimal passivation effect while restricting microcrystalline sowing on the shallow surfaces and inducing vertical growth of the subsequent doped nanocrystalline junctions. On this foundation, high-quality n- and p-type carrier-selective contacts can be achieved. Briefly, a 15-nm phosphorus-doped front n-type window layer (n+:nc-SiOx:H) grew on i:a-Si:H (2) as an electron collecting layer at a high hydrogen-to-silane gas-flow ratio of [H2]/[SiH4]/[PH3] = 750:5:0.1, with [CO2]/[SiH4] = 0.5  0.2 to balance the crystallinity fraction and optical bandgap. For the rear junction, the hydrogen-to-silane gas-flow ratio was further increased to [H2]/[SiH4]/[B2H6] = 2,700:5:0.1, imple- menting a 22-nm boron-doped p+:nc-Si:H film with an ultrahigh XC of 63.4%. The n+:nc-SiOx:H and p+:nc-Si:H contacts were grown in the same chamber at a substrate temperature of 170 C. Afterwards, a 2.8% Ce-doped In2O3 (ICO) target was applied for depositing approximately 70-nm TCO layers on both sides in a low-damage reactive plasma depo- sition sputtering tool by using high-purity Ar as the sputtering gas at a substrate temperature of 100 C, and the coating process was less than 30 eV ion bombardment, without damaging the microcrystalline emit- ters and the passivation layers. The contact-free LTP was carried out for grid lines with a line width of 18 μm and the aspect ratio was optimized to 0.7. For certificated cells, an 80-nm MgF2 layer was capped onto the front side in a thermal evaporation instrument (ULVAC, EI-501Z). Characterization Currentvoltage (IV) characteristics of the solar cells were measured by a Vision VS-6821S IV tester under standard test conditions (AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm2, 25 C). The best SHJ solar cells were certified through total area measurement by the Institute for Solar Energy Research in Hamelin. External quantum efficiency spectra were measured on the entire front surface including the grid-shaded area with a Bentham PVE300-IVT system and QE-RX (Enlitech), and the corresponding opti- cal loss was analysed using SQ-JVFL. HRTEM was conducted in an FEI Titan 80300 Berlin Holography Special TEM and TF-G20 (Thermo Fisher), for which the cross-sectional samples were prepared by a focused ion beam technique. The atomic force microscopy images and morphology features were obtained with semi-contact mode and an OMCL-AC200TS cantilever probe by Ntegra Prima. Crystallinity fractions (XC), also called crystalline volume fractions, were extracted by Raman spectroscopy with a 325-nm UV light generated by a HeCd laser, using a fitting Gaussian model. The optical characteristics of the layers, including absorbance, reflectance and transmittance, were measured using UVVisNIR spectroscopy (Perkin Elmer Lambda 950), and the bandgaps (Eg) of the layers were calculated from the Tauc plots. The minority carrier lifetime was obtained by a Sinton WCT-120 flash tester in transient mode. The vertical conductivities (σy) of the doped contacts, rather than the horizontal conductivities (σx), were detected by a self-built probe system, because the charges move vertically in the cells. Traditional doped a-Si:H layers are homogeneous (that is, isotropic (σy = σx)), and it is rational and more convenient to probe σx instead of σy. However, the nanocrystalline sowing and vertical growth induction process induces an oriented growth, producing anisotropic doped contacts (σy  σx), which causes unacceptable error if σx is used instead of σy. A Hall measurement system (Ecopia, HMS-3000) was used to determine the carrier mobility and conductivity of the TCO layers. The hydrogen content (CH) and microstructure factor (R*) were calculated from Fourier transform infrared responses captured by a Nicolet IS-10 spectrometer according to the following formulae.

Flexibility analysis and measurement The static structural module in the Ansys WORKBENCH software was used to simulate the flexibility of the 166  166 mm c-Si solar cells. The cell models were built in the Design Modeler, with an arc length of 166 mm and an initial 500 mm radius of curvature in the zx plane, and the one-dimensional 166-mm curves were extruded in the y direc- tion to form two-dimensional curved surface geometries. Inputting the parameters (density: 2,330 kg m3, Youngs modulus: 187 GPa, Poissons ratio: 0.28, yield strength: 7 GPa, tangent modulus: 63.7 GPa, tensile yield strength: 350 MPa) to the surface geometries, which were divided into 3-mm surface mesh in the Mechanical. Following that, remote displacement constraints in the y direction were applied to each of the straight edges, allowing displacement only in the x direc- tion and rotation only in the y direction, and the two straight edges were loaded with a horizontal force towards the centre. According to the first strength theory, the solar cells fracture when the maxi- mum principal stress exceeds or equals the limit of tensile strength, at which point the deformation of the solar cells in the x and z directions was recorded and the bending angle was calculated. The flexibility measurement of c-Si solar cells was completed by using a self-made programmed symmetrical extrusion system. Servo motors were used to control the relatively slow extrusion speed (1 mm s1) until the cells were broken, and the corresponding bending angles and radii of cur- vature were recorded. The concept of bendability refers to the property of being bent without breaking, which can be quantified by various parameters in different pieces of literature. In this paper, two indices are used for evaluation (that is, the maximum bending angle (θ) and the minimum bending radius of curvature (rb), and the relation formula is as follows. r l π θ = 360  2   b in which l is the length of the arc (equal to the cross-sectional edge length 166 mm). Encapsulation and ageing test The solar cells were encapsulated with the EPE encapsulant (EVA/POE/ EVA = 1:x:1, x = 11.2) into the modules, followed by measuring the initial maximum power (P0). The edges of the modules were attached with conductive copper tapes for grounding. The positive and negative terminals of the modules were connected to the high-voltage output power supply (1,500 V). The stability and persistence were tested in a high-temperature (85 C) and high-humidity (85%) ageing cham- ber (H8-050) for 192 h. Dividing the maximum power after the ageing tests (P1) by the initial maximum power (P0), the degree of attenuation can be assessed. A schematic diagram of the PID ageing process can be found in Extended Data Fig. 6. All of the encapsulation materials were pre-aged in the ageing chamber (UV-plus430 and GRO-SUV1010) at high temperature (85 C) and humidity (85%) with UV illumination (280400 nm, UVB accounts for 310% of the whole energy). The light-induced degradation ageing tests were conducted according to International Electrotechnical Commission 61215:2021. Absolute efficiency loss analysis The power and efficiency losses were quantified by Quokka3 simula- tion. The models of the FT and SF cells were established, and the input parameters such as TCO square resistance, line resistance, TCO/nc-Si( Ox):H/a-Si:H (2)/a-SiOx:H (1)/c-Si contact resistance, surface recombi- nation rate and so on were directly measured by experimental charac- terization. From the model and fitting variables, other parameters can be derived, including Auger recombination, radiation recombination and ShockleyReadHall recombination. Following convergence of the simulated and measured electrical properties, the efficiency loss components were quantified at the maximum power point. The con- cepts and calculation details of the theoretical limit and practical limit can be found in the literature30.
