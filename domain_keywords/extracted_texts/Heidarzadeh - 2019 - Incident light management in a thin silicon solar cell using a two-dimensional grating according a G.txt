Here, eﬃciency enhancement is done using a rectangular back grating with a Gaussian random distribution. The grating is one of the main optical trapping strategies. A rec- tangle grating is placed at the rear as a mirror that reﬂects and scatters light into absorber to increase the light traveling length inside the active region. DBR and horizontal grating is used in the rear side and we focus on non- uniformity of rectangle grating sizes to govern the light inside the cell. The results show using this structure, we can manage the absorption spectra and the photocurrent signiﬁcantly is increased. The eﬃciency of a 3 µm Si- type solar cell is increased near to 20%. In addition, when the angle of incidence is considered between 520, the eﬃciency of the proposed structure is higher than the normal incidence. It is believed that the obtained results are helpful in the design of a thin ﬁlm silicon solar cell. 1. Introduction Energy supply is one of the main challenges of mankind (Umbach, 2004; Armaroli and Balzani, 2007). One of the important issues for researchers is to ﬁnd an alternative for fossil fuels (Ediger and Kentel, 1999; Connolly et al., 2016). Meanwhile, advanced countries spend billions of dollars on research and development on clean energies (Georgeson et al., 2016; Kittner et al., 2017). Silicon has its unique characteristics like it is abundant in nature; the technology of semi- conductors is based on silicon, and that has high electron mobility (Heidarzadeh et al., 2014; Heidarzadeh et al., 2014; Heidarzadeh et al., 2016). The active area of a ﬁrst generation silicon solar cell has a large thickness (larger than 100 µm) (Battaglia et al., 2016; Yoshikawa, 2017). The fabrication of the crystalline silicon solar cells generally needs more costs (Heidarzadeh et al., 2015). So, designing a cell with a low thickness is more important. If the thickness of absorber is reduced, the less light can absorb inside that. Since the incident beam path in the thin absorber is reduced, it is necessary to ﬁnd a way to increase the traveling path of the incident light (Heidarzadeh et al., 2015). Back reﬂectors can be applied to the rear side, and that can improve the traveling length of the incident light (Heidarzadeh et al., 2015; Gao et al., 2014; Ahmad et al., 2018; Heidarzadeh and Tavousi, 2019). This mechanism is famous to the light trapping that has a very signiﬁcant eﬀect in dropping the material costs of the solar cells (van Lare et al., 2015; Ferry, 2010). Due to the extremely thin absorber, the light cannot be fully absorbed in a single pass. The solar cells are partly transparent and therefore the transmitted incident light does not convert into electrical energy. Therefore, various concepts, materials and coating systems are developed to enhance the photocurrent of the thin ﬁlm solar cells (Micha et al., 2019; Heidarzadeh et al., 2016; Mokari and Heidarzadeh, 2019; Sasihithlu et al., 2018). The incident light enters the cell through the front side and passes through the absorber (Mutitu et al., 2010). After passing through the silicon not absorbed light is reﬂected by a reﬂector into the active layer. Therefore, the light can travel the second pass through that; another opportunity arises for it to be absorbed. This light trapping eﬀect is particularly important for the long-wavelengths (red light), which are only weakly absorbed in the silicon. The short-wavelengths (blue light) are already absorbed after a few nanometers in the silicon. The combination of the rough interfaces with the rear-side reﬂector was used in some works that extend the light path inside the absorber and thus generate more photocurrent (Mutitu et al., 2010; Bermel et al., 2007). Nevertheless, the entire wavelength range beneﬁts from a rough interface at the front (Tan, 2015; Disney et al., 2017). One of the ways has been used for light trapping is a plasmonic technique (Catchpole and Polman, 2008; Jang et al., 2016; Mandal and Sharma, 2016; Heidarzadeh and Mehrfar, 2018). The in- teraction of incident electromagnetic wave and metals nanostructures excite the electrons to oscillate. Such resonant vibrations in nanos- tructures are called localized plasmons (Beck et al., 2009; Li et al., 2015). The number of studies devoted to the plasmonic eﬀect of https://doi.org/10.1016/j.solener.2019.07.099 Received 29 April 2019; Received in revised form 26 June 2019; Accepted 31 July 2019 E-mail address: heidarzadeh@uma.ac.ir.

T nanostructures in the ﬁeld of photovoltaic has been growing very ra- pidly (Mokari and Heidarzadeh, 2019; Yao, et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2019; Liu, 2019; Jangjoy et al., 2019; Heidarzadeh, 2018). For instance, broadband absorption and eﬃciency enhancement using plasmonic fractal and silver grating are reported in (Zhu et al., 2013) and (Shi, 2015), respectively. However, it is diﬃcult to adopt one narrow-band eﬀect to design the thin ﬁlm solar cells with high eﬃciencies and the combination of diﬀerent resonance modes is needed (Shi, 2015). Al- though using such systems can be solved some problem of thin ﬁlm solar cells but a number of practical problems have not been completely resolved up to now. The studies of plasmonic solar cells mainly focus on shape, size, type and other parameters of nanoparticles and there are some challenges for the actual environmental conditions like thermal eﬀect, recombination at the interface, absorption of metals nano- particles, fabrication of regular arrays, and etc. The periodic structures such as photonic crystals are other techniques that they have been used to control the incident light using their special optical properties (Andreani et al., 2015; Zhou and Biswas, 2008). Photonic crystals are of interest in many areas as they allow for targeted adjustment of optical properties (Tavousi et al., 2016; Tavousi and Heidarzadeh, 2018). Photonic crystals are periodic arrays of materials of diﬀerent refractive index, which aﬀects the light path using targeted diﬀraction and interference. An interesting application for thin-ﬁlm photovoltaic is the use of them as an angle and wavelength selective ﬁlter. The other way of light trapping is the use of diﬀerent shape gratings (Wu, 2018; Ye et al., 2019; Lin and Chiou, 2012). There is a great interest for grating structures to use for light trapping especially in a thin ﬁlm solar cell. A large variety of theoretical and experimental reports focused on them. They are designed in diﬀerent shape, geometry, and size. They beneﬁt from scattering. In (Feng, 2007) DBR and grating are used for light reﬂection and scattering at the rear side. The scattered light passes through the absorber layer at a shallow angle and remains there for a longer time. As mentioned, the ability of thin ﬁlm solar cells in the absorption of long-wavelength incident light is relatively weak and that is one of the main reasons for their low conversion eﬃciencies. In thinner absorbers, long-wavelengths are not suﬃciently absorbed, and the light traveling path length inside the absorber is much larger than the thickness of absorber. So, thin absorbers do not meet the require- ments for full absorption of the incident light. Therefore, to improve their conversion eﬃciencies while maintaining the low cost of mate- rials, it is necessary to capture photons with a long wavelength. This can be done using a back reﬂector in the rear side. In this research work, the eﬃciency enhancement is achieved by using a rectangular back grating with a Gaussian random distribution. They can be used to Fig. 1. Illustration of back reﬂectors through the generalized Gaussian distribution to design an appropriate light trapping systems. Fig. 2. Grating heights according a Gaussian distribution for 9 gratings (a) ξ = 0.3, and (b) ξ = 0.4. H. Heidarzadeh Solar Energy 189 (2019) 457463 458 design a high eﬃciency thin-ﬁlm silicon solar cell. It is expected that random grating is better than uniform grating structures due to their diﬀractive behavior and their electromagnetic wave interaction in a wide range of wavelengths. 2. Device design, analysis and results validation A thin ﬁlm solar cell consists of an absorber, an anti-reﬂect coating, and a back reﬂector in order to light trapping. Simplest back reﬂectors can be designed using distributed Bragg reﬂector (DBR) that consists of two layers of high and low refractive indices. In order to design a high- eﬃciency thin ﬁlm solar cell, a DBR plus a rectangular grating with a Gaussian distribution height is used. Fig. 1 depicts the proposed structure that can be used to trap incident light inside the active layer. For the backside, the gratings that their heights are arranged according to a Gaussian distribution is used. The ﬂat front surface consists of an antireﬂection coating (ARC) on top of the absorber with a suitable thickness that made from Si3N4. As seen in Fig. 1, at ﬁrst a cell with a period of p0 is assumed with a back DBR plus rectangle grating, then a cell with a period of p = n  p0 where n gratings are inside that. The gratings height is selected according to a gaussian distribution function. The aim is to design a thin ﬁlm absorber using a 2D rectangular grating whose component heights are not the same and their heights increase according to a Gaussian distribution. Performance parameters of such structure are investigated numerically. Considering a Gaussian distribution, the rectangular gratings heights is considered as Eq. (1). It is intended to use this special distribution for the design of a trapping structure. =             ( ) G n h xp ξ ( ) 1 2 n n 0 2 2 av (1) where h0 is the grating height of center grating, n is the grating number and here it is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, nav is the average number and here it is 5. For instance, in Fig. 2(a) and 2(b), the grating heights are shown as a function of grating number for ξ = 0.3 and ξ = 0.4, respectively, where h0 is 0.4 μm. To simulate the propagation of light inside the absorber and predict its behavior, a numerical method is considered. In the case of solar cell modeling, the suitable method depends on its geometry. The ﬁnite element method (FEM) is originally developed for the numerical solu- tion of complex problems. Here, the FEM as a powerful technique is used that solves numerically Maxwells equations. In this research work, the eﬀect of non-uniformity in size of the gratings is simulated. They used to guide the incident light into the active layer and trap it inside that. In our simulation, the refractive index of silicon in each wavelength is used from (Heidarzadeh et al., 2015). The wavelength- dependent absorption of Si has a key role in the calculation of its output parameters. The complex refractive index data of SiO2 is used from (Malitson, 1965). The AM1.5 solar spectrum is used as an incident spectrum. The incident light enters from ARC side and propagates in- side absorber. As the light rays propagate inside the silicon, they can be absorbed. The absorption spectra per unit volume can be calculated from the electrical ﬁeld intensity as Eq. (2).  = A λ ε ω ε ω E dv ( ) 1 2 (Im( ( ))) | | V 0 2 (2) where the vacuum and the material permittivity are represented by ε0 and ε, respectively, ω is the angular frequency, and E denotes the electric ﬁeld. The integral is done in volume. The total photocurrent that results from the incident light is given as Eq. (3).  = J q hc λA λ S λ dλ ( ) ( ) SC λ λ min max (3) where A(λ) is absorption spectra inside the absorber, S(λ) is the in- cident photon ﬂux and q is the an electron charge and λ is the wave- length of the incident light. The open circuit voltage (VOC) is the maximum voltage available from a solar cell that can be obtained as Eq. (4).   =   +   V KT e J J ln 1 OC ph 0 (4) where Jph is the photogenerated current, J0 is dark saturation current Fig. 3.

H. Heidarzadeh Solar Energy 189 (2019) 457463 460 At the end of this section, validation has been done by simulating a cell with a DBR back reﬂector using FEM and Rigorous coupled-wave analysis (RCWA). The simulated absorptance and transmittance spectra are depicted in Fig. 3(a) and 3(b), respectively. According to these ﬁgures, there is a good agreement with FEM results and RCWA results. 3. Simulation results and discussion Here, a back reﬂector is designed based on a DBR plus randomized grating. For more comparison, at ﬁrst, a 3 µm silicon solar cell is si- mulated without any back reﬂector. Fig. 4(a) shows its reﬂectance, transmittance and absorptance spectra. To its performance, a back re- ﬂector has been used. Reﬂectance, transmittance and absorptance spectra of a 3 µm absorber with a DBR back reﬂector are shown in Fig. 4(b). Fig. 4(c) depicts reﬂectance, transmittance and absorptance spectra of a 3 µm absorber with DBR plus Gaussian distribution grat- ings. It improves the absorptance due to its good reﬂection and scat- tering characteristics. Fig. 4(d) compares the absorptance of the three mentioned structures. As seen the absorption of some wavelengths is increased. It can be seen from the results in Fig. 4 that when a normal incidence plane wave with a wavelength of 0.41.2 µm is incident on a cell with the back gratings, the light reﬂectance under various struc- tures changes with the wavelength of the incident light. The absorp- tance of the reference cell without a back reﬂector is low in the long wavelengths. When it is patterned with a DBR plus gratings, the ab- sorptance is fundamentally improved in the wavelength range of 0.51.1 μm. As seen in Fig. 4, the ﬂuctuations occur in the spectra of reﬂectance, transmittance, and absorptance in the red and IR region that is due to interference eﬀects. They can be ascribed to Fabry-Perot eﬀects of the two interfaces of the absorber when light irradiates on that. It is important to mention that such oscillation behavior matched well with previous works (Zhang et al., 2014; Foroutan et al., 2016; Yu et al., 2017; Da and Xuan, 2013). For a clear comparison, in Fig. 5(a) external quantum eﬃciency as a function of wavelength are calculated for the cells with DBR plus Gaussian grating, DBR plus a plane grating, only DBR, and without any back-reﬂector. It is important to mention that to ignore the oscillation behavior, the average external quantum eﬃciencies are compared. As seen in this ﬁgure, the external quantum eﬃciency of a cell with DBR plus gaussian grating is higher than in other cases. The reason for the better improvement of DBR plus gaussian grating in comparison to a periodic grating is that the diﬀractive behavior of such grating will be distributed over a wider range of the solar spectrum. To further Fig. 6. Current-voltage characteristics for h0 = 0.4 µm and p0 = 0.6 µm as a function of Gaussian standard division (ζ) and comparison of them by absorber without grating, and reference cell. Fig. 7. Eﬃciency for p0 = 0.6 µm and hg = 0.3 µm, 0.4 µm and 0.5 µm as a function of Gaussian standard division (ζ). Fig. 8. (a) Current-voltage characteristics as a function of angle of incidence for a cell with 3 µm thickness and a DBR plus Gaussian distribution grating back reﬂector with period = 0.6 µm, hg = 0.4 µm and ζ = 0.3, and (b) Comparison eﬃciency as a function of angle of incidence for a cell with DBR plus Gaussian grating, DBR plus plane grating and only DBR. H. Heidarzadeh Solar Energy 189 (2019) 457463 461 comparison, the eﬃciencies of mentioned structures as a function of cell thicknesses are simulated in Fig. 5(b). The DBR and gratings act as a back reﬂector with this diﬀerence that gratings diﬀract the incident light into the absorber with certain angles according to their diﬀraction orders. Due to the diﬀractive behavior of gaussian gratings, they cause better eﬃciency enhancement. As seen a cell with a DBR plus gaussian gratings has better perfor- mances. So, for more comparison, current-voltage characteristics of a 3 µm absorber without back reﬂector, with a DBR back reﬂector and with a DBR plus Gaussian granting back reﬂector is calculated in Fig. 6. It is important to mention, the height of center grating is 0.4 µm (h0 = 0.4 µm), the period is 0.6 µm and the Gaussian standard division (ζ) is compared for 0.15, 0.2, 0.25, 0.3, 0.4. As seen for the Gaussian standard division of 0.3, the best performance is obtained due to its better diﬀraction behaviors. In Fig. 7, the eﬃciency of a 3 µm silicon solar cell for the center grating height (h0) of 0.3 µm, 0.4 µm, and 0.5 µm as function Gaussian standard division (ζ) is calculated. The results show that the eﬃciencies of all the cells using any grating structures is improved but the maximum eﬃciency is achieved when h0 is 0.5 µm. From an optical perspective, the angle of incident light is another factor that can play important roles in a cell with a grating back re- ﬂector. In Fig. 8(a) the current-voltage characteristics as a function of the angle of incident light are simulated. As seen the maximum current is obtained for the angle of 12. It is concluded that the angle depen- dence of the current-voltage is due to this fact that gratings scatter the incident light in diﬀerent directions. So, this angle of the incident can be used to improve the performance of a thin solar cell. Further com- paring the eﬀect of the angle of incident, in Fig. 8(b) the eﬃciency as a function of angle of the incident light is plotted for the cells with DBR plus Gaussian gratings, DBR plus plane grating, only DBR. It can be seen from this ﬁgure, DBR plus Gaussian gratings can eﬀectively improve the eﬃciency in the incident angle ranges of 520 better than normal in- cident (0) and its performance is better than two others. The above conclusions can be deeply understood by the principle of total reﬂection in physical nature and the Brewsters (polarization) angle. 4. Conclusion In this research work, the eﬀect of non-uniformity in grating size on the performance of a Si-type solar cell is investigated. A 3 μm silicon solar cell based on this structure is designed and analyzed. The designed structure exhibits extraordinarily high absorption in the whole range of the solar spectrum. The higher absorption makes the simulated struc- ture as a good alternative for practical photovoltaic application. The conversion eﬃciency of Si-cell with an assembly grating structure as a function of Gaussian standard division is calculated. It is also found that eﬃciency slightly depends on the angle of incident and for the angle of 12, the maximum eﬃciency is accessible.
