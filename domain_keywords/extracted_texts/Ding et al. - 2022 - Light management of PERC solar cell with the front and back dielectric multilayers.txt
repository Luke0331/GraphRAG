With the help of simulation, we designed and fabricated the industrial Ga-doped single-crystalline silicon (sc-Si) PERC solar cells by integrating the silicon oxynitride (SiOxNy) with the traditional silicon nitride (SiNx) dielectric films on both the front and rear surfaces. In the front, the SiOxNy capping effectively decreased the reflectance in the short-wavelength light range, thus increased the cells short circuit current (Isc) by 50 mA. In the back, the SiOxNy layer was inserted into the rear SiNx film, thus increased the internal reflection at the rear surface in the long-wavelength light range, resulting in an about 24-mA Isc gain. Totally, with the front and rear light management, the champion samples showed the significant improvement with an about 80-mA increment in Isc of cells compared with the baseline group.

Improving light management is one of the main ways to achieve high cell efficiency, and the methods can be mainly classified into the following categories: (i) reduction of electrode shading on the front side, including the double printing and back contact3,4; (ii) texturing on wafer surface, such as the anisotropic texturing, plasma texturing, laser texturing, and metal-catalyzed chemical etching58; (iii) improvement of front anti-reflection film, such as the double-layer, three-layer even gradient anti-reflection coating (ARC)911; (iv) increase of internal reflection, such as the back surface structure optimization and application of rear dielectric layer.12,13 Moreover, considering cells light management under mass production conditions and module framework are of great significance. For front anti-reflection, a single-layer ARC only shows significant effect at the specific light wavelength, while a multilayer ARC exhibits better effect in a broader wavelength range. Unfortunately, the total thickness of the reported best double-layer and three-layer ARCs are usually more than 150 even 200 nm.14,15 Such thick films severely restrict the production output due to the long deposition time. Meanwhile, firing the metal contact through a thick film is difficult in production, so the ohmic contact of emitter is affected accordingly. The ARCs with graded refractive index (RI)16 or the subwavelength struc- tures17,18 have been reported to effectively reduce the reflection, but the fabrication processes are complex and not suitable for mass Received: 28 February 2021 Revised: 16 June 2021 Accepted: 12 September 2021 DOI: 10.1002/pip.3475 180  2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Prog Photovolt Res Appl. 2022;30:180190. wileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/pip production. When we come to the rear surface, being not strongly absorbed in the wafer, the incident light with long-wavelength experi- ences multiple reflection at front and rear interface. Consequently, escape loss at the front interface and the rear metal parasitic absorption loss at rear surface are inevitable. Some simulations revealed that apply- ing dielectric layer with low RI to the rear surface of a solar cell can reduce the metal parasitic absorption.19,20 This method can increase the rear internal reflection, but the simulation results need more sup- port from experiments. In addition, the photonic crystal Bragg reflectors were reported to be used to improve the internal reflection.21 But it is incompatible with mass production due to the total thickness being over 1 um. In conclusion, it is necessary to further optimize the front anti-reflection and rear internal reflection in practical application. SiOxNy films fabricated through plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) were reported to be used in the ARC of solar cells due to its low absorption and adjustable RI.22,23 However, most of the studies on the front SiOxNy ARC were limited to the performance of cells, while the reporting on the corresponding PV modules is still scarce. In this paper, we integrate SiOxNy layers with popular SiNx layers on Ga-doped sc-Si PERC solar cells to improve the light manage- ment of both the front and rear surfaces. First, we simulate front anti- reflection and rear internal reflection by using the vector method and transfer matrix method, respectively. We confirm that the front anti- reflection effect can be effectively enhanced by introducing a SiOxNy layer with a low RI and an appropriate thickness in the front of the cell. As for the back internal reflection, it can also be increased by employing a SiOxNy layer with a low RI and a sufficient thickness in the back of the cell. Second, with the guidance of the simulation results, we opti- mize the front ARC and introduce the SiNx/SiNx/SiOxNy stacks to com- pare with the traditional double-layer SiNx ARC. The best new stack effectively reduces the reflectance of cells and modules in the short- wavelength range, increases the short circuit current (Isc) by 50 mA and increases the efficiency by absolute 0.1% in the cells. It also achieves a 0.71-W power gain in the modules. Third, with the help of simulation, we improve the capping layer of the rear Al2O3 passivation layer from a single SiNx structure to a SiNx/SiOxNy/SiNx structure. The rear internal reflection is increased. And for the cells in the best sub- group, the Isc is increased by 24 mA, and the efficiency is increased by absolute 0.07%. Finally, compared with the baseline group, the cham- pion group with both optimized front and rear light management pos- sesses a 80-mA increment in Isc, an about absolute 0.18% increment in efficiency of the cells and a 1.75-W gain in the power of the mod- ules. We also use the SunSolve to perform the reflectance simulation of cells in the baseline and champion groups.24 The comparison shows that the experimental and simulated results are in good agreement. 2 | EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS 2.1 | Wafer grouping Our experiments were carried out on (100) oriented Ga-doped sc-Si wafers with a thickness of 170 um, an area of pseudo-square 16.17 cm  16.17 cm, and a resistivity of 0.51 Ωcm. For achieving comparable wafer quality, 3900 adjacent wafers were equally divided into 12 sister groups. 2.2 | Cell fabrication The solar cell fabrication processes are shown in Figure 1A. Three stages, named as the front-end process, the film deposition process, and the back-end process, were separately described in the following part. The difference of experiment designs was only in the film deposition process. 2.2.1 | Front-end process: From texturing to thermal oxidation After alkaline texture in a batch-type wet bench (BatchTex, RENA corporation, Germany), the uniform emitter was formed in a tube dif- fusion furnace (TS-81254, Tempress, Netherland) with POCl3 as the doping source. Subsequently, a selective emitter was obtained using a laser doping tool (SE-DY80, DR laser, China). After that, the etching of edge side and rear surface combined with PSG removal was per- formed in an inline-type wet bench (InOxSide, RENA corporation, Germany). Then, the wafers were placed back to back in a furnace tube (TS-81254, Tempress, Netherland). Under oxygen atmosphere at 680C for 10 min, SiO2 films with thickness about 2 nm were formed for better front surface passivation. 2.2.2 | Film deposition process The Al2O3, SiNx, and SiOxNy layers on the rear or front surface were all deposited using the PECVD method in a tube furnace (T-ALOX, Hanwha, South Korea). The schematic drawings of different layer structures are shown in Figure 1B. For the baseline, the commonly used double-layer SiNx ARC with high/low RI (2.3/2.09) was depos- ited on the front surface, and the traditional Al2O3/SiNx stack was formed on the rear surface; here, the RI and thickness of the Al2O3 and SiNx film are 1.61/10 and 2.03/110 nm, respectively. In the front SiOxNy group, the new front SiNx/SiNx/SiOxNy designs were applied, the RI and thickness of the first and second SiNx layers were kept as 2.3/20 and 2.09/35 nm, for the third SiOxNy layer, the thickness was kept as 50 nm, and the RI was varied from 1.89 to 1.50. In the rear SiOxNy group, the new rear SiNx/SiOxNy/SiNx stacks capping the Al2O3 passivation layer were used, the RI and thickness of the inner and outer SiNx films were all kept as 2.03/30 nm, for the middle SiOxNy film, the RI was designed as 1.50, and the thickness was changed from 20 to 150 nm. Subsequently, the best front and rear dielectric layer design in these subgroups were integrated in the front/rear SiOxNy group (champion group). Noted that the values of RI for dielectric films mentioned in this work were all measured at 600-nm wavelength.

The front surface texture was simplified as a regular pyramid structure, and the pyramid facet angle was set as 52. To prepare following simulations and experiments, it is neces- sary to first confirm the RI and extinction coefficients of SiNx and SiOxNy dielectric layers. The two kinds of layers with different precursor gas flow ratios have been fabricated via PECVD, the RI and extinction coefficients of the layers have been measured and presented in Figure S1. As we discussed in introduction, the ARC thickness of the baseline was set below 100 nm according to the mass production conditions. For the front surface, a popular double- layer SiNx ARC with RI/thickness designed as 2.3/20 and 2.09/55 nm (note as 1st-SiNx and 2nd-SiNx in Figure 2, respectively) is set as the baseline. On the basis of the consideration of not only realizing better front anti-reflection effect but also achieving compa- rable PID resistance25 and passivation effect,9 we kept the 1st-SiNx layer (RI = 2.3) but decreased the thickness of the 2nd-SiNx layer (RI = 2.09) from 55 to 35 nm. After then, a SiOxNy layer with FIGURE 1 (A) Fabrication flows and (B) schematic drawings of four test groups: Baseline, front SiOxNy, rear SiOxNy, and front/rear SiOxNy 182 DING ET AL. 1099159x, 2022, 2, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pip.3475 by Xian Jiaotong University, Wiley Online Library on [18/06/2025].

The vector method is a useful technique in the ARC design to find optimized structures.26,27 Here, two assumptions are involved: First, there is no absorption in the layers; second, only one reflection at each indi- vidual interface is considered. Though this method is not rigorous, it is a good approximation for most ARC problems where the absorp- tion in the dielectric layer is ignorable and the overall reflection from the multilayer is small.26 As shown in Figure 3a, the overall reflection vector Rsum is given by the sum of the reflection vectors r1,R2,R3,and R4 originate from each interface26: Rsum ¼ r1 þR2 þR3 þR4, R2 ¼ r2e2iδ1, FIGURE 2 Schematic diagram of light propagation at the front and rear surfaces FIGURE 3 (A) Schematic diagram of front structure for simulation.

And the reflectance can be calculated by get- ting the square of the magnitude of Rsum. Solar cells work in a certain wavelength range and the cell performance is influenced by the photon flux and internal quantum efficiency. The WAR is introduced to represent the effective reflec- tance, which can be calculated using the following Equation as reported in literature.10 WAR ¼ Ð λ2 λ1Fi λ ð ÞQi λ ð ÞR λ ð Þdλ Ð λ2 λ1Fi λ ð ÞQi λ ð Þdλ , where Fi(λ),Qi(λ), and R(λ) represent the photon flux, internal quantum efficiency, and reflectance, respectively, and the wavelength range is from 300 to 1200 nm. Figure 3B shows the contour map of the simu- lated WAR versus the variable RI and thickness. It can be seen that reducing RI from 2.09 to 1.5 can decrease the WAR, which implies that the anti-reflection effect can be effectively enhanced by intro- ducing SiOxNy film with low RI and appropriate thickness. We also simulated how SiO2 films with thickness of 2/5/10 nm affect the front anti-reflection performance, no other obvious rules were observed and detailed results can be found in Figure S2. For the rear surface, we need to keep light wave away from the aluminum (Al) layer in order to enhance the utilization rate of long- wavelength light. By this method, the metal parasitic absorption can be reduced, and more light can be reflected back to the silicon wafer and absorbed again. The interaction between the Al layer and light waves was reported to be related with the critical angle θc ¼ arcsinn2 n1:19 When the incident angle θ  θc, the light propagating in dielectric layer follows the propagating wave form. And the light absorption of the Al layer is determined by the primary reflected beam Ra and secondary reflected beam Rb. If the destructive interference happens, more light will reach the Al layer and the parasitic absorption will be increased. When the incident angle θ  θc, light becomes eva- nescent and decays exponentially in the dielectric layer. The charac- teristic penetration depth dp(θ) of the evanescent wave can be calculated as following28: dp θ ð Þ ¼ λ 2πn1 ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ sin2θ  n2 n1  2 r Here, λ is the wavelength in air, n1 is the RI of silicon wafer and n2 represents the RI of the dielectric layer. If the thickness of the dielectric layer is less than the penetration depth, incident light reaches the Al layer and high absorption is caused there. The transfer matrix method28 is employed to analyze the optical fields of dielectric layers at different light incident angle. Here, the normal SiNx layer (RI is 2.03) and the low RI SiOxNy layer (RI is 1.5) with different thickness were designed. The corresponding contour maps of rear internal reflectance at wavelength of 1100 nm are dis- played in Figure 4A,B. As we can see, the critical angle θc decreases when the normal SiNx layer is replaced by low RI SiOxNy layer. Mean- while, smaller penetration depth and weaker destructive interference are observed for the structures with low-RI SiOxNy layers. Hence, the overall rear internal reflection distribution is much better for the low RI SiOxNy layer compared with the normal SiNx layer. This result implies that introducing the lower RI SiOxNy with sufficient thickness can reduce metal parasitic absorption and the rear internal reflection can be increased consequently. The effect of rear Al2O3 passivation layer with thickness of 10 nm was also taken into account, the result is shown in Figure S3 in supporting materials. No special guidance was found except the internal reflection was slightly enhanced. 3.2 | Application of SiNx/SiNx/SiOxNy structure to improve front anti-reflection In our previous analysis and simulation, we have confirmed that the front anti-reflection effect can be effectively enhanced by applying a low RI SiOxNy film with an appropriate thickness. Considering the fea- sibility of mass production, the thickness of the SiOxNy layer is limited to be 50 nm, and total ARC thickness is designed to be 105 nm, and the RI of SiOxNy film is varied from 1.89 to 1.50. The detailed designs of the baseline and the five front SiOxNy subgroups named from A1 to A5 are presented in Table 1, which are also marked in the WAR simulation in Figure 3B. Main electrical parameters of the six groups of cells are shown in Figure 5A. It can be seen that both the short circuit current (Isc) and efficiency of the front SiOxNy groups are higher than those of the baseline group. When the RI of SiOxNy decreases from 1.89 (A1) to 1.72 (A3), compared with the baseline, the Isc and efficiency firstly rise to the maximum and achieve the gain of 50 mA and absolute 0.1%. Then, they slightly decrease with the RI continuing to decrease. At the meantime, there is no obvious change in the open circuit volt- age (Voc) and fill factor (FF), indicating that the new film structure has no side effect on the passivation and ohmic contact. Figure 5B shows the reflectance and EQE curves of different groups. As the RI decreases from 1.89 to 1.50, the reflectance in the wavelength range of about 300450 nm is decreased, while the reflectance between about 5001000 nm is increased. This result shows that decreasing the RI of SiOxNy film reduces the reflectance in the short-wavelength region and also causes the reflectance in the middle and long- wavelength region to increase. The A2 and A3 groups better balance the reflectance in different wavelength region, which leads to the bet- ter Isc. The left and right insets in Figure 5B are the digital photos of cells in the baseline and A2 group respectively. We can see that A2 cell is darker than the baseline cell attributed to its better anti- reflection effect. 184 DING ET AL. 1099159x, 2022, 2, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pip.3475 by Xian Jiaotong University, Wiley Online Library on [18/06/2025].

The schematic drawings of structure and corresponding RI distribution of the front ARC of cell and module can be referred in Figure 6A,B. Power results are shown in Figure 6C. It can be seen that the module power of A1 and A2 group show an upward trend, but the down- ward trend starts from A3 to A5 group. The module power of A2 is the highest and with an average increase of 0.71 W compared with the baseline. In order to better understand this phenomenon, single-cell modules were made to test the reflectance and EQE. And the test results can be found in Figure 6D. We can see that the reflectance decreases significantly after cells being encapsulated, which is attributed to the introduced polymer encapsulant (RI is about 1.5) reducing the RI gap of the top interface. This reason can also explain the reflectance decrease between about 300450 nm as shown in Figure 6D. Moreover, the RI of A1A5 is getting closer and closer to the RI of the polymer encapsulant, which results in poor optical coupling in the middle and long-wavelength range (about 5001000 nm) at the encapsulant/SiOxNy interface. For A4 (RI = 1.62) and A5 (RI = 1.50), the reduced short-wavelength anti- reflection ability, which cannot compensate for the loss in the mid- dle and long-wavelength region. This also leads to their module power to be even lower than that of the baseline group. Consider- ing the above results of the cells and modules, one can see that the A2 group exhibits the best performance. 3.3 | Improving internal reflection by introducing rear SiNx/SiOxNy/SiNx capping layer As we have discussed in the previous simulation, applying a SiOxNy layer with a low RI and a sufficient thickness can effectively reduce parasitic absorption in the Al layer, which consequently increases the internal reflection at the rear surface. Here, the SiNx film with RI and thickness designed as 2.03 and 110 nm is the capping layer of the 10-nm Al2O3 passivation film and is served as the baseline, consider- ing that the oxygen element in SiOxNy film can react with Al paste, which would cause the Al2O3 passivation layer to be contaminated during the fast-firing process.29 So we chose a SiNx/SiOxNy/SiNx structure. The design parameters are shown in Table 2, for the rear SiOxNy groups including B1B5, the RI and thickness of the two outer SiNX layers are kept as 2.03 and 30 nm, the RI of the middle SiOxNy layer is kept as 1.5, and its thickness varies from 20 to 150 nm. The six groups are also marked in Figure 4. FIGURE 6 Schematic drawings of structures and RI distributions of (A) front ARC of cell and (B) module.

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License Figure 7A shows main electrical parameters of cells. With increase of SiOxNy thickness, the Isc and efficiency of B1B3 groups are increased, but they are almost unchanged from B3 to B5 group. The average Isc of B3 group increases by 24 mA, and the efficiency increases by absolute 0.07%. Figure 7B shows the reflectance and EQE curves of different groups. Compared with the baseline, the reflectance of B1B5 is enhanced in the wavelength range from about 1050 to 1180 nm, which is due to the increased rear internal reflec- tion causing more light to escape from front surface. It also implies that less light is absorbed by Al layer and more lights can contribute to the carrier generation. In addition, the reflectance of B1B3 group is on an upward trend, but the increase amplitude of B3B5 group is relatively small compared with B1B3 group. A similar phenomenon is also observed in EQE curves. It can be interpreted that B3 provides sufficient back internal reflection. Combined with the previous simula- tion in Figure 4, two reasons probably can account for the above results: First, the strong surface wave propagating in the region near the critical angle θc can cause more energy transfer to the Al layer. So the internal reflection near that region is low. Thus, it is important to avoid the primary incident angle (40 for pyramid texture)30 to be close to the critical angle. Compared with the SiNx (RI = 2.03) layer, the SiOxNy (RI = 1.50) layer has bigger gap between critical angle and the primary incident angle. Therefore, the internal reflection of the SiOxNy case is increased. Second, a saturation phenomenon starts when the thickness of dielectric layer is higher than the penetration depth of evanescent waves. 3.4 | 0.17% efficiency gain in the champion group We have applied SiOxNy films to the front ARC and the rear capping layers and achieved good light management and electrical perfor- mance. Then, we have tried to combine the best front ARC group (A2) with the best rear capping group (B3) and applied them to PERC cells. Here, we name the combination group as the front/rear SiOxNy group (champion group) as introduced in Figure 1A. The layered struc- ture on both front and rear side can be seen in Figure 8. (the sample was etched by 1% HF for 30 seconds to show the morphology clearly). Figure 9A shows the electrical parameters of cells in the baseline and champion groups. The champion group achieves 80 mA higher Isc and 0.18% higher efficiency.

Figure 10A shows the power of the 60-cell modules, compared with the baseline group, the champion group gains 1.75 W more power. Figure 10B shows the reflectance and EQE curves of the single-cell modules. As we can see, the reflectance and EQE in both the short- and long-wavelength range are improved in the champion group. Furthermore, SunSolve has been used to simulate the reflec- tance of cells. Detailed parameters are shown in Table S2. Figure 11 shows the simulated and measured reflectance curves of cells in the baseline group and champion group. Compared with the baseline group, the champion group owns advantages of reduced reflectance in short-wavelength region and enhanced reflectance in long- wavelength region for both simulated and measured results. The simulation trends are basically consistent with the test results. How- ever, it should be noted that reflectance gap of the simulation results is bigger than that of the test values in long-wavelength region. The difference may be resulted from the rear morphology of tested cell is not as flat as planar surface set in the simulation. Another possible reason is the Al layer used in the simulation calcu- lation is dense, while the Al layer in experimental situation is incompact.31 4 | CONCLUSIONS On the basis of the analysis and simulation, we applied SiOxNy films in both the front and rear of Ga-doped sc-Si PERC solar cell to optimize its light management. In the front, compared with the conventional front double-layer SiNx ARC, the best tested sub- group (A2) with the SiNx/SiNx/SiOxNy multilayer structure achieved better anti-reflection effect and EQE in short-wavelength range for both cells and modules. It exhibited a 50-mA increment in Isc, an about absolute 0.1% increment in efficiency of the cells and a 0.71-W gain in power of the modules. Furthermore, we substituted SiNx/SiOxNy/SiNx multilayer for the commonly used SiNx rear capping layer. The SiOxNy films with low RI and suffi- cient thickness effectively reduced the back Al layer parasitic absorption of long-wavelength light. The best subgroup (B3) exhibited a 24-mA increase in Isc and an about absolute 0.07% increase in efficiency of the cells. Finally, A2 and B3 were integrated into the champion group, the Isc of the cells increased by 80 mA, the efficiency increased by absolute 0.18%, and the average power of the 60-cell modules increased by 1.75 W. The reflectance curves of both the cells and modules clearly indicated that the decreased reflectance in the short-wavelength range and increased reflectance in the long-wavelength range were realized together. We believe this work is feasible to bring better light management and electrical performance for PERC solar cells in mass production.
